  abstract = {Parasitic crustaceans are ubiquitous in marine environment. They have negative effects on host individuals and populations, and even on the ecosystem where the host species plays a great role. In this short review, we show two case studies of marine invasions related with parasitic crustaceans from Kuroshio Region. One is the native pinnotherid crab parasitizing introduced mussels and the other is the bopyrid isopod introduced from Asia to US Pacific Coast. The green mussel Perna viridis, native to the tropical Indo-Pacific region, has recently been introduced worldwide. Although the native mussel populations in India suffer from parasitic effects of the pinnotherid crab Arcotheres placunae, mussels are relatively free from parasitic crabs in invaded regions (parasite escape). We investigated pea crab infections in P. viridis in Uranouchi Inlet, Kochi Prefecture, Japan. Results showed that the native generalist pea crab A. sinensis utilized the non-indigenous mussel P. viridis, though the prevalence is much lower. The introduced Asian parasitic bopyrid isopod, Orthione griffenis, was first discovered on the Pacific coast of North America ca. 25 years ago. High prevalence of Orthione infestations decreased many local populations of the host mud shrimp Upogebia pugettensis as well as the diverse symbiotic fauna in the host burrows. We investigated the distribution and host specificity of the bopyrid in western Japan. Results showed that O. griffenis was a rare species in Japan. Further ecological studies on parasitic crustaceans are needed in both native (source) and introduced (recipient) habitats.},

  abstract = {With the opening of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in July 1931, therewas inaugurated a program of investigations in the deep waters of the western NorthAtlantic for which there had long been a great need. In contrast to most deep-sea investigations, which have had to be planned as single expeditions, the Institution was ableto initiate a general program which could be carried out gradually in order to take advantageof knowledge gained during the course of the work. Suffcient funds having beenprovided for the continuous operation of its research vessel "Atlantis," work could beplanned for all seasons of the year.Although these investigations have not been in progress for long and new data arecontinually being brought in by the "Atlantis," there are several reasons that make itseem desirable at this time to publish a preliminary report based on the completed temperatureand salinity observations. In the first place, the problem of oceanic circulationis such that we cannot hope for a satisfactory solution for a long time to come. Moreover,it would be unwise to allow too much data to accumulate, because several yearsmay pass before we can arrive at more important conclusions. Secondly, both the chemicaland biological programs undertaken at the same time, require as a background thegeneral scheme of circulation in the western North Atlantic as well as the distribution oftemperature and salinity. It is, in fact, the necessity of taking into consideration themovements of the sea water which ties together the whole subject of oceanography.Therefore, it is the duty of those interested in ocean circulation to make available theirfindings as soon as possible for investigators of other problems in the same area.The "Atlantis" temperature and salinity observations discussed in these pages wereplanned with two main purposes in view. The first objective was an intensive study ofseasonal changes along sections running from the southwestern corner of Nova Scotiato Bermuda and from Bermuda to the mouth of Chesapeake Bay.! This, of course, includedan examination of fluctuations in the Gulf Stream, as well as of the variations inthe water masses on each side of it. Second, there has been planned and partly carriedout, a more general survey of the western North Atlantic, where accurate, deep stationshave been sadly lacking.},

  abstract = {Abstract Previous studies of the long-wave perturbations of the free atmosphere have been based on mathematical models which either fail to take properly into account the continuous vertical shear in the zonal current or else neglect the variations of the vertical component of the earth's angular velocity. The present treatment attempts to supply both these elements and thereby to lead to a solution more nearly in accord with the observed behavior of the atmosphere. By eliminating from consideration at the outset the meteorologically unimportant acoustic and shearing-gravitational oscillations, the perturbation equations are reduced to a system whose solution is readily obtained. Exact stability criteria are deduced, and it is shown that the instability increases with shear, lapse rate, and latitude, and decreases with wave length. Application of the criteria to the seasonal averages of zonal wind suggests that the westerlies of middle latitudes are a seat of constant dynamic instability. The unstable waves are similar in many respects to the observed perturbations: The speed of propagation is generally toward the east and is approximately equal to the speed of the surface zonal current. The waves exhibit thermal asymmetry and a westward tilt of the wave pattern with height. In the lower troposphere the maximum positive vertical velocities occur between the trough and the nodal line to the east in the pressure field. The distribution of the horizontal mass divergence is calculated, and it is shown that the notion of a fixed level of nondivergence must be replaced by that of a sloping surface of nondivergence. The Rossby formula for the speed of propagation of the barotropic wave is generalized to a baroclinic atmosphere. It is shown that the barotropic formula holds if the constant value used for the zonal wind is that observed in the neighborhood of 600 mb.},

An arbitrary disturbance (corresponding to some inhomogeneity of an actual system) may be regarded as analysed into ``components'' of a certain simple type, some of which grow exponentially with time. In all the cases examined there exists one particular component which grows faster than any other. It is shown how, by a plocess analogous to ``natural selection'', this component becomes dominant in that almost any disturbance tends eventually to a definite size, structure and growth-rate (and to a characteristic life-history after the disturbance has ceased to be ``small''), which depends only o n the broad characteristics of the initial (unperturbed) system. The characteristic disturbances (forms of breakdown) of certain types of initial system (approximating to those observed in practice) are identified as the ideal forms of the observed cyclone waves and long waves of middle and high latitudes. The implications regarding the ultimate limitations of weather forecasting are discussed.},

The second-order effects on a zonal current due to the presence of very simple unstable baroclinic waves are then analysed, using a two-level model of finite lateral width without friction or heat sources. In addition to the poleward transport of sensible heat and the creation of kinetic energy by these waves, it is shown that they are accompanied in this model by a weak meridional circulation. This circulation consists of an indirect cell in middle latitudes with direct cells to the north and south. The possible importance of this mechanism in providing appropriately distributed sources and sinks of relative zonal momentum (and therefore in prescribing the distribution with latitude of the surface zonal winds) is demonstrated with the aid of Widger's observations of the horizontal momentum transfer by eddies during January 1946. Finally it is shown that about 95 per cent of the perturbation energy in the unstable waves of this type comes from the ``potential energy'' of the basic current, the small remainder coming from the kinetic energy of that current.},

The linear velocity field thus considered consists of the rates of stretching deformation and shearing deformation, vorticity, and divergence (or negative convergence). A group of foreign particles initially arranged in a circle surrounding a singularity will be deformed into an ellipse the area of which increases or decreases with time depending on the sign of the divergence. When a random motion is superposed upon the velocity field, a group of particles will be subject to advectiondiffusion. As a result of the combined action of the rates of stretching and shearing, vorticity, and random motion, the group size tends to grow against a collecting power of convergence toward the singularity. Asymptotically a stationary situation may be established in which a group of particles attains a certain limiting size. Only the theoretical aspect is considered.},

  abstract = {A large-scale hydrophysical experiment aimed at studying ocean currents variability was conducted at a selected site (`polygon') centred at 16{\textdegree}30{${'}$} N and 33{\textdegree}30{${'}$} W in the Tropical Atlantic. The experiment involved six U.S.S.R. research vessels and a cross-shaped network of buoy-stations laid out within a square 113 {\texttimes} 113 nautical miles. Currents and water temperature were continuously recorded by this network at various depths. Each of the buoys was replaced every 25 days, special arrangement being made to have overlapping records during each replacement operation. Additional research programmes were conducted from participating ships. Current records revealed an extremely high variability both in time and in space even after filtering out the inertial and tidal oscillations from these records. Density stratification seems to affect the mean current vector rotation with depth as well as the inertial and tidal currents which, as a result, have qualities of large-scale three-dimensional internal waves. Among other studies measurements of small-scale thermohaline structure deserve particular attention. It is likely that the observed thermohaline microstructure is related to an intermittent mixing regime in which double-diffusivity convection interplays with larger scale turbulence of both convective and dynamical origin.},

In the same area and period (October to December, 1968) 60 days of current records were obtained at six depths from the surface down to 2000 m; they show that the meander and eddy circulations are confined to the upper 1000 m and are weak with surface currents of only 30{\textendash}75 cm/sec. The energy of the eddy is shown to reside principally in the form of available potential energy, which is present in the local deformation of the density field and estimated to be 1023 ergs; this quantity is 30 times larger than the total kinetic energy of the circulation (3{\texttimes}1021 ergs). Estimates are made of the rate of destruction of the total energy of the eddy by (i) enhanced heat loss to the atmosphere and (ii) dissipation of kinetic energy by turbulent vertical diffusion: the eddy lifetime from these processes is estimated as 6 months and 1 year respectively.},

  abstract = {The theory of large-scale seasonal variations of temperature, salinity, sea-level, velocity, etc. in the ocean is considered herein. Regions near the boundaries and within 15{\textdegree} of the equator are excluded. It is found that, for the scales considered, the heat input is mainly stored locally and horizontal advection by the mean flow is not particularly important. Effects of vertical advection and of seasonal changes of horizontal advection in the Ekman layers are calculated for 5{\textdegree} squares in the North Atlantic and North Pacific and also found to be relatively minor. Observational evidence is discussed. Contributions to sea-level changes are calculated for each season for 5{\textdegree} squares in the North Atlantic and North Pacific. First, there is a response to changes in atmospheric pressure which is particularly important (a few cm) at high latitudes. This response is, however, dynamically uninteresting as temperature, velocity, etc. are hardly changed. Second, there is the barotropic response to changes in the wind stress. This produces small changes (a few mm) in sea-level on the scales considered, and corresponding changes of bottom pressure. Velocity amplitudes increase to about 3 mm sec-1 in the west, corresponding to horizontal displacements of 15 km. Although these values seem small, the associated transports, spread over 20{\textdegree} of latitude, are considerable (30 {\texttimes} 106 m3 sec-1). However, since topographic effects are so important for barotrophic motions, the large transports are confined to deep water regions and would not, for instance, be expected to contribute much to seasonal changes of transport through the Florida Straits. Because the changes in bottom pressure are small, the sea-level changes are approximately isostatic, as concluded from observational studies. On the other hand, there is reason to believe that large barotropic changes will be found in regions of closed contours of H cosec {$\varphi$}, where H is the depth and {$\varphi$} the latitude. Thirdly, there are steric changes in the sea-level. The major change (a few cm) is produced by expansion and contraction of the water column above the seasonal thermocline due to changing fluxes of heat and water across the surface. Currents of a few mm sec-1 are produced above the seasonal thermocline by the changes in density field, but the transport over 20{\textdegree} latitude is under 106 m3 sec-1. There are other, less important, steric changes (usually less than 10\%) due to movements induced by the changing wind stress, and these effects have been explicitly calculated by season for the North Atlantic and North Pacific. The changes involve (1) changes in the mixed layer due to convergences of heat and salt produced by Ekman fluxes, and (2) changes produced by Ekman pumping which displace the main thermocline up or down by a few metres. The latter change represents the baroclinic response which increases in strength towards the equator, although even at 15{\textdegree} (where the analysis breaks down), currents are only about 1 mm sec-1. The baroclinic response dominates the barotropic response at low latitudes, while the reverse is true at high latitudes. The two responses are comparable at 30{\textdegree}. Fourthly, there is a tidal component, Sa (Doodson, 1921; Wunsch, 1967) with a period of 1 year and an amplitude of a few mm which will not be discussed herein. Large-scale anomalies in the surface temperature of the ocean are discussed qualitatively, although these are not seasonal changes. It is suggested that the main changes are simply due to changes in the heat flux through the surface, and changes in the convergence of heat in the Ekman layer, the latter becoming significant at low latitudes. Simple ways of modelling the changes can be employed for regions not too close to the equator.},

Let u and v denote the eastward (approximately onshore) and northward (approximately alongshore) components of the currents. The mean alongshore velocity v has the structure of a baroclinic coastal jet, whose maximum speed occurs near the surface at a distance of about 15{\textendash}20 km from the shore, whereas the fluctuating part of v has the structure of a roughly barotropic coastal jet whose maximum occurs very near ({$<$}4 km) the shore. The standard deviation of v is approximately depth-independent whereas that of u decreases with depth. As one approaches the coast, the standard deviation of u decreases whereas that of v rises steeply, consistent with the behavior expected of coastally trapped wave motion. A scatter plot of the velocity fluctuations in a hodograph plane indicates that the fluctuations roughly follow the direction of the local isobaths. The Reynolds stresses in an east-north coordinate system therefore change sign because of the change of direction of the isobaths in the region. The v fluctuations seem to be mutually better correlated than the u fluctuations throughout the region, suggesting that the u components may be affected by ``turbulence.'' By finding the time lag corresponding to maximum correlation between stations separated alongshore, the velocity fluctuations have been found to propagate northward approximately nondispersively at a mean velocity of about 500 km day-1 during 1972 and 120 km day-1 during 1973. A method for performing the empirical orthogonal decomposition for two-dimensional vector time series has been formulated and applied to the velocity field over the continental shelf.},

An interpretation of the effects of Reynolds stress{\textemdash}mean flow interaction work for open regions is presented in terms of the change in the total mean kinetic energy. In an arbitrary volume of fluid the changes in kinetic energy of the mean flow and the mean kinetic energy of the eddy flow are not generally equal and opposite, so this process is not generally responsible for a conversion of energy between the two forms. These ideas are then applied to a regional kinetic energy analysis of the mesoscale resolution general ocean circulation numerical experiment of Robinson et al. (1977). The spatial structure of the various terms in the equation for the mean eddy kinetic energy is examined. The issues involved in selection of a set of analysis regions are discussed and explored via examination of budgets over different subregions of this flow. Thereby a relatively simple picture of the regional energetics emerges. Mean eddy kinetic energy is produced by conversion of kinetic energy of the mean flow in the net over the recirculation and near field of the northern boundary current system and roughly half of this energy is lost to each of mean eddy pressure work transport and diffusion work. Budgets over subregions of this net source region are much more complex. The interior eddy field is driven by pressure work influx, while the southwestern region has eddy buoyancy work conversion of mean potential energy as its energy source. At every depth level the eddy field draws its kinetic energy from the mean flow, when averaged over the horizontal extent of the basin or over the recirculation and near field.},

  abstract = {Abstract Results from a two-layer, quasi-geostrophic, general circulation model of the ocean with fine horizontal resolution are presented. As in Holland and Lin (1975a.b), mesoscale eddies spontaneously arise due to instabilities in the oceanic currents, giving rise to transient oceanic circulations that reach a statistical equilibrium. In these final equilibrium states, the interaction of the eddy field with the mean state is examined, and it is shown that the eddies determine the character of the large-scale mean flow. In particular, the eddies act to limit the amplitude of the mean flow in the upper ocean, are responsible for a downward energy propagation that fills the deep sea with eddy energy, and create a downward momentum flux which is responsible for the creation of deep, time-mean, abyssal gyres that are an important component of the vertically averaged mass transport in the ocean. Three new aspects of the mesoscale eddy problem are discussed. First, the Holland and Lin (1975a,b) results are extended to highly nonlinear free jets, a simple but more realistic treatment of the Gulf Stream as the source for mesoscale eddy energy. Second, bottom friction is examined as the likely mechanism for energy dissipation in a quasi-geostrophic turbulent flow; lateral dissipation enters as an important enstrophy sink but not as an important energy sink. Finally, the usefulness of the quasi-geostrophic nature of the model is demonstrated; only one-tenth of the computer time needed for two-layer primitive equation experiments is required for quasi-geostrophic ones with comparable resolution.},

  abstract = {The Mid-Ocean Dynamics Experiment (MODE-1) was designed to investigate mid-ocean mesoscale eddies. An intensive and extensive program of measurements in three spatial dimensions and time was undertaken in an area southwest of Bermuda from March through mid-July 1973. Principal components of the experiment were an array of moored current meters and temperature-pressure recorders, hydrographic stations, drifting neutrally buoyant floats at 1500 m tracked by SOFAR, and acoustic and electromagnetic profilers. During MODE-1 a smaller scale survey relying on ship-tracked neutrally buoyant floats, a conductivity-temperature (CTD) survey, and a moored current meter array, MINIMODE, was carried out. The experiment was preceded by MODE-0, consisting of measurements by a series of moored current meters and other instruments in the general area selected for MODE-1. MODE-1 observations were generally within a 300-km radius circle centered at 26{\textdegree}N, 69{\textdegree} 40{${'}$}W, with a greater concentration of observations in the interior of the circle. The region covers varied topography, with a flat a byssal plain sloping upward to the continental rise in the western half and rough topography in the eastern half. Descriptive, dynamical, numerical results of the experiment are presented. It is concluded that mid-ocean eddies are part of an energetic and structured variability field superimposed on the weaker gyre-scale mean circulation. In the western North Atlantic there is a band of eddy variability of around 100-day period and 70-km scale in which currents are horizontally nearly isotropic; vertical scales are of the order of the depth. The experiment provided conclusive evidence of the existence of mid-ocean eddies and serves as the basis for future experiments, such as POLYMODE, to extend our knowledge of these systems.},

Systematic studies are made of the consequences of varying the frictional coefficient, the vortex amplitude, the vortex radius (relative to the deformation radius), the degree of nonlinear coupling between the two vertical modes and the initial vertical structure of the vortex. Results of note include the following. Within the approximation of a single vertical mode model (i.e., in the absence of modal coupling), a baroclinic vortex has an increased westward and a finite meridional propagation speed when its amplitude is greater than infinitesimal. Both of these speeds, however, are limited by the wave speeds (as determined from infinitesimal amplitude theory) of the weak dispersion field outside the vortex. The vortex amplitude dec...},

Large-amplitude variations are confined in the region between 4 and 15{\textdegree}N. Near 6{\textdegree}N the variations in depth propagate westward. Near 12{\textdegree}N they have almost the same phase across the ocean from the American coast to 145{\textdegree}E.

Near 12{\textdegree}N, the rate of change in thermocline depth is nearly in phase with the Ekman pumping velocity, with only a minor but significant contribution coming from Rossby wave propagation.

Rather than restricting the flows to be weak (but solutions to the relevant dynamics), we have considered motions where the streamfunction is only a kinematic model resembling the actual flows but the amplitude can be large so that flow speeds can greatly exceed the phase speed. For steadily propagating disturbances, there is an equivalent one-dimensional Lagrangian motion problem and we have applied results from analyses of such to periodic channel waves and isolated circular eddies. We show that the mean Lagrangian drift rate in periodic channel waves is very sensitive to the initial position and may be either prograde or retrograde. Large volumes of the fluid may be ``trapped'' to translate along with the wave. The wave drift depends on the phase velocity relative to the Eulerian mean flow and peaks at about 1/3 of the transient Eulerian speed at geophysically relevant amplitudes. For isolated eddies such as Gulf Stream rings, we calculate the trapped volume carried with the eddy and the displacements of the particles outside. We show that some particles may translate quite large distances along with the eddy while others move rapidly in the opposite direction and are left behind.},

  abstract = {Abstract In this paper an analytical method is proposed for calculating the nonlinear {$\beta$}-induced translation of isolated baroclinic eddies. The study focuses on frictionless anticyclonic eddies with a uniform anomalous density and a lens-like cross section which translates steadily in a resting Ocean. The depth of these eddies vanishes along the outer edge so that as they translate westward their entire mass anomaly is caused along with them. The proposed method for calculating the translation speed incorporates the nonlinear equations of motion in an integrated form and a simple perturbation scheme. It relates the translation of the eddy to its intensity, size and volume, but requires only an approximate knowledge of the corresponding numerical values. The power and usefulness of the proposed method is demonstrated by its application to a class of simply-structured eddies whose swirl velocity increases monotonically with the distance from the center. It is found that the translation of these eddies is considerably smaller than that of a simple Rossby wave. A small Rossby number eddy whose swirl velocity increases monotonically with the distance from the center translates westward at approximately {$\frac{1}{3}\beta$}Rd2 (where Rd, is the deformation radius), whereas the most nonlinear eddy (whose negative relative vorticity approaches the vorticity of the earth) translates at {$\frac{2}{3}\beta$}Rd2. The proposed method is tested by its application to more complicated anticyclonic eddies representing those shed by the Loop Current in the Gulf of Mexico. For these eddies, the predicted westward translation speed is 0.32{$\beta$}Rd2 which agrees very well with both numerical experiments and field observations.},

Six quasi-synoptic data sets are used to describe the evolving circulation of the Gulf of Mexico from October 1966 to September 1967, showing the separation and movement into the western Gulf of three anticyclonic rings. The historical data are used to determine that these rings typically translate to the west at a mean speed of 2.1 km day-1. Their length scale as defined by their rms radii is 183 km. An estimate of ring life-span, as defined by an e-folding time, is one year. Within the context of the Gulf's water property distributions, these rings appear as warm salty bodies. The heat and salt added by one of these rings after separation are estimated to be 7{\texttimes}109 J m-2 and 17 g cm-2, respectively. The heat and salt added by one of these features play an important role in the heat and salt budget of the western Gulf. The latter indicates that about one ring per year must advect into the western Gulf to balance the western Gulf's salt budget. Past studies (e.g., Behringer et al., 1977) have attempted to track the rings into the western Gulf by identifying their presence in the water property data using the high-salinity core of the Caribbean subtropical underwater. It is shown that this high-salinity core is transformed into Gulf of Mexico common water by convective mixing during the winter months. It is concluded that any attempt to define the forcing mechanism for the western anticyclonic cell described by Nowlin and McLellan (1967) must take into account the westward moving rings.},

Quasi-stationary meanders in the Kuroshic Current System occurred at 137{\textdegree}C (i.e., Kuroshio Meander), at 144{\textdegree}E and 150{\textdegree}E (i.e., lee-wave meanders), and near 160{\textdegree}E (i.e., meander over the Shatsky Rise). A composite of the paths of the Kuroshio (i.e., the 12{\textdegree}C isotherm) from the individual seasonal maps, and the total variance map, finds nodes (i.e., minima) and anti-nodes (i.e., maxima) of variability to have existed along the mean Kuroshio path. The anti-nodes coincided with the location of the quasi-stationary meanders, the nodes in between. Zonal propagation of temperature anomalies accounted for 20{\textendash}30\% of the total interannual variance. These temperature anomalies propagated eastward at 0.5{\textendash}1.5 cm s-1 in the region 140{\textdegree}{\textendash}155{\textdegree}E, and westward at -1 to -2 cm s-1 in the region 155{\textdegree}E{\textendash}175{\textdegree}W. In addition to this wave propagation, 31\% of the interannual variance in temperature could be explained by two empirical standing-wave modes. Within these two modes, spatial coherency in variability existed between the Kuroshio Meander, the two lee-wave meanders east of Japan and the meander over the Shatsky Rise. Both spatial patterns of variability fluctuated with a 1-year decorrelation time scale, with maximum interannual variability occurring in fall/winter and minimum interannual variability in spring/summer. In the latter part of the 4-year period (1979{\textendash}80), the Kuroshio Meander became weak and the Kuroshio Extension was displaced southward, from 36{\textendash}37{\textdegree}N during the first 2 years to 34{\textdegree}N during the latter two years. Associated with these large scale changes, the quasi-stationary meander pattern in the Kuroshio Extension became unstable, associated with increased eddy activity and ring production. In fact, ring production doubled, i.e., from 5 per year to 10 rings per year, from what it was during the previous 3 years. Prior to this regimal change, the Kuroshio Extension bifurcated near the Shatsky Rise (160{\textdegree}E) with a secondary branch of the Kuroshio Extension extending northeastward along the Shatsky Rise to 40{\textdegree}N, where it turned east, and with the main branch extending eastward along 36{\textdegree}N. After the regional change, this bifurcation occurred much farther to the west near 150{\textdegree}E.},

Variable parameters in the study are sense of rotation (cyclonic/anticyclonic), vertical structure (baroclinic, barotropic), and layer thickness ratio (H1/H2). Eddy size and strength (rotational velocity) and frictional parameterization are fixed. Dispersion in the isolated eddy is induced by planetary and topographic beta-effects, giving the eddy an asymmetric distribution. This asymmetric distribution allows for nonlinear self-advective propagation tendencies. These nonlinear tendencies play a key role in the direction of propagation of the eddy. Specifically, in a quiescient background, an anticyclone can have eastward propagation tendencies which can overcome planetary and topographic beta-effects. Conversely, cyclones can have westward propagation velocities which are augmented (greater than maximum Rossby wave phase speed) by the presence of a topographic slope. This suggests that cyclones may be more likely to propagate onto a continental shelf region than their anticyclonic counterparts of equal strength.},

  abstract = {The mechanisms that contribute to the generation and damping of large-scale mid-latitude sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies are discussed. The SST anomalies reflect primarily the response of the upper ocean to the changes in air-sea fluxes that are associated with daily weather fluctuations. Heat flux forcing is dominant in the lower middle latitudes, while wind-driven entrainment may be most effective in the high latitudes; advection by anomalous Ekman current is generally less important, and Ekman pumping is negligible. The SST anomalies decay in part because of entrainment effects associated with mixed-layer deepening and oceanic mixing and in part because of heat exchanges with the atmosphere. The three approaches commonly used to model the evolution of SST anomalies are reviewed: case studies based on monthly or seasonal anomaly maps of the large-scale SST and atmospheric anomalies, numerical simulations with one-dimensional mixed-layer models, and stochastic forcing models. We stress the similarities in the different approaches and discuss their main advantages and limitations. The response of the atmosphere to mid-latitude SST anomalies is considered. First, we discuss the poorly known relationship between SST anomalies and diabatic heating. Using a crude assumption for the air-sea coupling, we consider a two-layer quasi-geostrophic channel model and discuss the stationary wave response to SST anomaly forcing and the resulting air-sea feedback. It is found that the back interaction of the SST anomalies onto the atmosphere causes a weak SST anomaly damping at large scales and a strong one at small scales; the air-sea coupling should also act as an eastward propagator for the SST anomalies. The response of more realistic linear wave models to prescribed diabatic heating is then reviewed, and it is suggested that realistic mid-latitude SST anomalies have a weak influence on the atmospheric circulation, corresponding to changes in the geopotential height of 10{\textendash}30 m at most. This order of magnitude is consistent with the results of general circulation model experiments and with the limited climate predictability associated with mid-latitude SST anomalies.},

Issues involved include the synoptic and regular gridding of asynoptic non-uniform data, the construction of composite fields from several data types, and the initialization and verification of the dynamical model. Models for the error fields required for weighted combinations of independent field estimates are obtained from the analysis of an observational model; a barotropic example is presented. The statistical model is applied to the POLYMODE Synoptic-Dynamic Experiment (SDE) XBT and current meter data which is successfully assimilated in the dynamical model. Dynamical forecasting experiments are carried out and the difference fields between analysis fields and forecast fields are studied and attributed to: error sources in the analysis, in initial and boundary data, and to the dynamical adjustment of those fields by the model. Quantitative results indicate that useful accuracies can be efficiently obtained.},

The behavior can be characterized by two drastic events. The first was the abrupt movement of the Kuroshio Front in December 1981, forming a bulge of the Kuroshio Water with a diameter of about 200 km. The bulge was cooled uniformly by an active air-sea interaction in winter, and became mixed with other waters. The analysis of the mixing process shows isopycnal mixing modifying almost the whole bulge water, and also a diapycnal mixing caused by an advection of the Kuroshio Water across the Kuroshio Front. The latter is closely connected with the second event, which started around 18 April and resulted in a warm-core ring detachment early in June. The formation process of the ring is described in detail by combining hydrographic data with the satellite data, and a hypothesis of the ring formation is given.},

Many of the masses were accompanied by excessive discharge of fresh water from major rivers in southern Japan and were observed 20{\textendash}40 days after the discharges. The salinity difference between the low-salinity water mass and the Kuroshio was closely proportional to the river water discharge. To specify their origin, the behavior of a water mass seen on 10 August 1979 was studied in detail. A large number of labeled particles were deployed in the water mass and were tracked numerically by the Euler-Lagrangian method. The fresh water forming the low-salinity water mass in the Kuroshio was concluded to originate in the Seto-Inland Sea and the Tosa Bay, and 58\% of the river water discharge was sufficient to form the low-salinity water mass. When a particle in the Kuroshio flows along the southern coast of Japan, it receives coastal water which is discharged in excess due to snow melting in spring and heavy rainfall such as that caused by a stagnating front, a cyclone or a typhoon. The parcel of coastal water is estimated to move from the river mouth to the continental shelf region at a mean speed of 5{\textendash}10 cm s-1.},

  abstract = {Artificial neural net models have been studied for many years in the hope of achieving human-like performance in the fields of speech and image recognition. These models are composed of many nonlinear computational elements operating in parallel and arranged in patterns reminiscent of biological neural nets. Computational elements or nodes are connected via weights that are typically adapted during use to improve performance. There has been a recent resurgence in the field of artificial neural nets caused by new net topologies and algorithms, analog VLSI implementation techniques, and the belief that massive parallelism is essential for high performance speech and image recognition. This paper provides an introduction to the field of artificial neural nets by reviewing six important neural net models that can be used for pattern classification. These nets are highly parallel building blocks that illustrate neural net components and design principles and can be used to construct more complex systems. In addition to describing these nets, a major emphasis is placed on exploring how some existing classification and clustering algorithms can be performed using simple neuron-like components. Single-layer nets can implement algorithms required by Gaussian maximum-likelihood classifiers and optimum minimum-error classifiers for binary patterns corrupted by noise. More generally, the decision regions required by any classification algorithm can be generated in a straightforward manner by three-layer feed-forward nets.},

  abstract = {Abstract Increasing evidence suggests that the Gulf Stream system is the origin for much of the eddy variability observed in the northwestern Atlantic Ocean. However, the dynamical mechanisms by which eddy energy, once generated in the neighborhood of the Gulf Stream, penetrates into the midocean regions are not fully understood. Here we explore the proposition that radiation away from the Gulf Stream can be interpreted as an oscillatory response of the ocean gyre interior to the forcing associated with translation and temporal evolution of the Gulf Stream current and its meanders. Specifically, we propose as a possible mechanism responsible for pules of Rossby wave radiation the sudden growth to finite amplitude and successive amplitude pulsations of quasi-stationary or eastward-moving finite-amplitude meanders. To examine this mechanism in detail, we construct a model for radiation in which the quasi-geostrophic equivalent barotropic potential vorticity equation is forced to its northern boundary by assigned distributions of streamfunction and vorticity corresponding to 1) a stationary pulsating meander, 2) a slowly propagating meander, and 3) a combination of 1 and 2. We use both analytical and numerical techniques to solve the linear boundary-forced initial value problem with and without lateral friction and with and without bottom topography. We focus not only on the steady forced response but also on the transient component of the interior Rossby radiation field. On the {$\beta$}-plane without topography, it is shown that radiation into the far field is only possible for meander pulsation below a critical frequency. Below this frequency, the transient far-field response is large and force basin modes are necessary, together with the forced equilibrium solution, to accommodate the prescribed initial state of the system. With the addition of viscosity to damp the transient basin modes, and for frequencies higher than the critical value, the response is trapped at the northern wall and no radiation can be supported in the far field. The inclusion of a simple parabolic relief along the full channel does not modify the qualitative behavior of the interior field. The only effect of the parabolic relief is to modify the effective value of planetary {$\beta$} and the cross-channel structure of the westward-propagating Rossby modes.

In particular, new mechanisms are possible for the development of far-field radiation and for the appearance of nonlinear, coherent solutions, as will he shown in Part II of this paper.},

Hydrographic surveys revealed the presence of both small-scale and large-scale baroclinic waves on this front, the latter reaching wavelengths of 5-10 internal Rossby radii.

  abstract = {Abstract Instability processes in frontal jet regions outside the western boundary currents are examined for their ability to produce mesoscale variability comparable to that observed in the open ocean. The important of sufficient numerical resolution for a correct modeling of these processes is considered. Using a local {$\beta$}-plane quasi-geostrophic multilevel model with periodic horizontal boundary conditions, the combined effects of special density and current profiles typical for the midlatitude eastern North Atlantic are studied. The linearized approach yields a set of vertical shear modes with different vertical structure depending on the zonal wavelength of the perturbation. Some of these shear modes are unstable; the mesoscale range (50{\textendash}500 km) reveals two different types; a surface intensified shear mode and a deep-sea intensified one. The growth rates of the former are usually largely exceeding those of the latter due to the larger velocities and shears. Their exponential amplification time scale ranges from one to three weeks. In the nonlinear model idealized initial states are integrated in time for about two months. Stochastically or locally perturbed jets produce strong meandering including eddy detachment. The initial growth rates are comparable with linearized theory and the vertical structure can be illustrated in terms of linear shear modes.},

Five current meter moorings obtained verlocity and temperature data at four different depths for approximately one year. These data were used to estimate eddy kinetic and potential energy flux divergences and the rates of energy conversion between the eddy and mean fields in both the Gulf Stream and the Deep Western Boundary Current. Based on our results and those of others, we argue that (i) the Gulf Stream is on average baroclinically unstable in this region, although energy release from the horizontal shear dominates near the surface; (ii) eddy pressure work is an important component of Gulf Stream eddy energetics and acts as a sink of eddy energy at 73{\textdegree}W; (iii) the Deep Western Boundary Current appears to be baroclinically unstable; (iv) Gulf Stream eddies are affected by the ``far-field"; and (v) the eddy-field at 73{\textdegree}W is significantly different in its effects on the Gulf stream than that upstream on Hatteras or that at 68{\textdegree}W, although the interaction rates are of comparable magnitude. We propose a hypothesis of eddy field dynamics in the vicinity of the Gulf Stream from the Florida Straits through the Gulf Stream extension.},

Here, these data are used to analyze the energy budgets of the Gulf Stream mean flow with a view towards examining gulf stream vertical structure and inertial character. We find that Gulf Stream dynamics exhibits considerable vertical structure at our experiment site. At 380 m, the kinetic energy flux appears to be convergent, but the eddies augment mean kinetic energy. Order of magnitude estimates of processes involving vertical velocity appear to be too small to account for this mismatch; hence, we conclude that a conversion of mean kinetic to mean potential energy, via flow up a mean pressure gradient, must be occurring, Opposite tendencies are found at 880 m, leading to conclusion that the Gulf Stream is flowing down a mean pressure gradient at this depth. Evidence supporting a situation similar to the observations in terms of northward shifts of the gyre structure with depth. Of course, our observations are undoubtedly influenced by lateral topography, bottom topography and eddies and the effects of these are poorly understood from a theoretical point of view. We also present evidence that the Deep Western Boundary Current is restoring energy to the deep potential energy field by flow up a mean pressure gradient. The rates are considerably smaller than those in the Gulf Stream but structurally resemble our results at 380 m.},

  abstract = {Abstract Three Meddies were tracked for up to two years in the Canary Basin using neutrally buoyant SOFAR floats. These Meddies have cores of warm, salty Mediterranean Water and are approximately 100 km in diameter, 800 m thick, and are centered at a depth of 1100 m. Meddy 1 was tracked for two years (1984{\textendash}86) with five floats as it drifted 1090 km southward with a mean velocity of 1.8 cm s-1. Four shipboard surveys made during these two years revealed the nearly total decay of Meddy 1 by gradual mixing processes. Meddy 2 drifted 530 km southwestward over 8.5 months with a mean velocity of 2.3 cm s-1 until it collided with Hy{\`e}res Seamount near 31{\textdegree}N, 29{\textdegree}W. The floats trapped in this Meddy then stopped looping abruptly, implying a major disruption of this Meddy. Meddy 3 drifted 500 km southwestward for a year and a half with a mean translation velocity of 1.1 cm s-1. A comparison of the velocity of Meddies to the velocity of nearby floats at 1100 m depth outside of the Meddies shows clearly that all three Meddies moved southwestward through the surrounding water at a speed of about 1.3 cm s-1. The floats inside the Meddies looped anticyclonically in a nearby solid-body rotation with a period of 6 days for Meddy 1, 4 days for Meddy 2, and 5 days for Meddy 3. The rotation period of Meddy 1 appeared to remain constant over nearly two years despite a large decrease in the Meddy's thickness and diameter due to mixing. Rotation velocities in the Meddies were as great as 34 cm s-1 (Meddy 2), much faster than speed of nearby floats outside of the Meddies.},

STMW cores were identified as vertical potential vorticity minima, and examined by the use of apparent oxygen utilization as an indicator of the age of STMW. The main results can be summarized as follows. 1) A major post of the STMW appearing in the summer (or the winter) sections is the water formed in the immediately previous winter, its age being half a year (or one year). 2) Within half a year after its formation the STMW can be advected to the 137{\textdegree}E section only as far south as about 26{\textdegree}N and as far as about 23{\textdegree}N within one year. 3) Typical potential temperature in summer was higher than in winter, with salinity higher and potential density lower. 4) Less STMW was observed during the period of the typical large meander of the Kuroshio in the later 1970s. 5) The salinity of STMW was relatively low before 1981; it increased considerably in the summer of 1981 and has since showed a slowly decreasing trend.},

Here, recpatiulation is sought, and, within the confines of a single-layer model, a generalized formula is derived. Although it is similar to Nof's, the present formula is established from a modified definition and with fewer assumptions. It also recaptiulates all other formulae for the one-layer model and applies to a wide variety of situations, including cases when the vortex develops a wake of Rossby waves or undergoes axismmetrization. Following the derivation of the formula, a physical interpretation clarifies the migration mechanism, which can be divided between a self-induced propulsion and a reaction from the displaced ambient fluid. Numerical simulations with primitive and geostrophic equations validate the formula for a variety of length scales and amplitudes. The work concludes with an attempt to extend the result to systems with two moving layers.},

The major low frequency velocity fluctuations in the lower 1000 to 2000 m of the water column in the three regions have the characteristics of topographic Rossby waves (TRWs). Spectral peaks are observed at periods of about 25 days and 40 to 100 days. Motions are highly coherent with depth. Variances increase toward the bottom despite the very weak stratification of the deep waters of the Gulf. Wave-lengths are about 150{\textendash}250 km and phase propagation is offshore with energy propagation westward. A group velocity of about 9 km day-1 could be directly estimated from significantly coherent signals between eastern and western arrays. This value is consistent with estimates derived from the dispersion relation and is higher than the westward translation speed of 3 to 6 km day-1 of the large anticyclonic eddies shed from the Loop Current. It appears that a major source of TRWs are the fluctuations of the Loop Current and there is evidence that the deep water fluctuations become progressively more decoupled from upper layer currents as the TRWs and warm eddies propagate into the western basin.},

  abstract = {Long baroclinic Rossby waves are potentially important in the adjustment of the tropical Pacific pycnocline to both annual and interannual wind stress curl fluctuations. Evidence for such waves is found in variations of the depth of the 20{\textdegree}C isotherm in the northern tropical Pacific during 1970{\textendash}1987. A total of 199,067 bathythermograph profiles have been compiled from the archives of several countries; the data coverage is dense enough that westward propagating events may be observed with a minimum of zonal interpolation. After extensive quality control, 20{\textdegree}C depths were gridded with a resolution of 2{\textdegree} latitude, 5{\textdegree} longitude, and bimonths; statistical parameters of the data were estimated. A simple model of low-frequency quasi-geostrophic pycnocline variability allows the physical processes of Ekman pumping, the radiation of long (nondispersive) Rossby waves due to such pumping in midbasin, and the radiation of long Rossby waves from the observed eastern boundary pycnocline depth fluctuations. Although the wind stress curl has very little zonal variability at the annual period in the northern tropical Pacific, an annual fluctuation of 20{\textdegree}C depth propagates westward as a long Rossby wave near 5{\textdegree}N and 14{\textdegree}{\textendash}18{\textdegree}N in agreement with the model hindcast. Near the thermocline ridge at 10{\textdegree}N, however, the annual cycle across the basin is dominated by local Ekman pumping. The wave-dominated variability at 5{\textdegree}N weakens the annual cycle of geostrophic transport of the North Equatorial Countercurrenl in the western Pacific. El Ni{\~n}o events are associated with westerly wind anomalies concentrated in the central equatorial Pacific; up welling wind stress curl is generated in the extraequatorial tropics by these westerlies. Long up welling Rossby waves forced by this curl pattern were observed to raise the western Pacific thermocline well outside the equatorial waveguide in the later stages of El Ni{\~n}os, consistent with the simple long-wave model. The observations suggest that although simple reflection of the long Rossby waves from the western boundary is not the major process affecting subsequent development on the equator, it is likely that the extraequatorial waves play some role in setting the timescale of ENSO events.},

Using a particle-in-cell method, numerical experiments illustrate the merging process and the accompanying Lagrangian motions. In any merger event, three stages can be distinguished. In the first stage, intrusions from each eddy wrap around the other eventually substituting particles of one eddy almost completely with those of the other. The second and rapid stage is the merging per se, leaving a new, elongated eddy. In a prolonged third stage, stabilization of this eddy proceeds with axisymmetrization and rejection of fluid to the surroundings. Such rejection of fluid, which is demonstrated to be essential for the conservation of potential vorticity, energy and angular momentum, proceeds with the formation not of filaments, as in Euler's dynamics, but of satellite vortices. The center eddy may or may not axisymmetric completely, but, in all cases, consists of a thorough mixture of particles from both original eddies. Other numerical experiments with cyclones and zero{\textendash}potential-vorticity anticyclones indicate that these vortices are resistant to merging. The impacts of the planetary beta effect and of eddy pulsation on merging are also considered.},

The mechanisms that generate the KCC and the KBC are studied using a barotropic inflow-outflow model with a simplified basin configuration of the East China Sea. The present study shows that the KCC can only exist on a {$\beta$}-plane frame of reference and its flow pattern is independent of the offshore Ryukyu Islands. In the East China Sea, the continental slope plays the role of a western boundary for the Kuroshio. Whether the Kuroshio protrudes onto the slope region, however, is found to have little influence on the KCC. Concerning the formation of the KBC, we found that the planetary {$\beta$}-effect and the existence of Taiwan Island are two indispensible conditions: the planetary {$\beta$}-effect drives part of the Kuroshio inflow to branch southwestward and Taiwan Island blocks this branched current causing it to protrude onto the continental shelf. Based on the numerical calculation, we further found that the branch current is reinforced by topographic Rossby waves induced by the repeated crossing of the Kuroshio over the continental slope.},

  abstract = {Abstract The energetics of a Southern Hemisphere cyclone wave have been analyzed using ECMWF data and the results of a limited-area model simulation. An analysis of the energy budget for a storm that developed in the eastern Pacific on 4{\textendash}6 September 1987 showed the advection of the geopotential height field by the ageostrophic wind to be both a significant source and the primary sink of eddy kinetic energy. Air flowing through the wave gained kinetic energy via this term as it approached the energy maximum and then lost it upon exiting. Energy removal by diffusion, friction, and Reynolds stresses was found to be small. The most important conclusion was that, while the wave grew initially by poleward advection of heat as expected from baroclinic theory, the system evolved only up to the point where this source of eddy energy and the conversion of eddy potential to eddy kinetic energy (typically denoted ``{$\omega\alpha$}'') was compensated for by energy flux divergence (dispersion of energy), mainly of the ageostrophic geopotential flux, va{$\phi$}. Energy exported in this fashion was then available for the downstream development of a secondary system. This finding seems to differ from the results of studies of the life cycle of normal-mode-type waves in zonal flows, which have been shown to decay primarily through transfer of energy to the mean flow via Reynolds stresses. However, this apparent inconsistency can be explained by the fact that while ageostrophic geopotential fluxes can also be very large in the case of individual normal modes, the waves export energy downstream at exactly the same rate as they gain from upstream. The group velocity of the 4{\textendash}6 September storm, calculated from the ageostrophic geopotential height fluxes, showed that the energy packet comprising the system had an eastward group velocity slightly larger than the time-mean flow.},

All of the identified Reddies are found in the regions where the factor P (which denotes the probability of RSW being present at a hydrographic station) has high horizontal gradients.

We use an objective analysis technique for quantitative scale separation to investigate the interaction of scales in the region. The large scale is clearly dominated by an anticyclonic gyre. Smaller scale analysis shows the existence of several mesoscale cyclonic eddies along the northern boundary of the western Albor{\'a}n sea anticyclonic gyre. The relationship between the large-scale/mesoscale variability and the induced ageostrophic vertical motion is established using the Q vector formulation. We find that on the macroscale, upward motion occurs upstream of the anticyclonic gyre (upstream of a wave crest) while downward motion takes place downstream (upstream of a trough). We also show that the vertical motion associated with the mesoscale eddies is an order of magnitude higher than the large-scale vertical motion. These patterns of large-scale and mesoscale vertical motions are confirmed by an extensive sensitivity analysis and by an independent estimate of the large-scale vertical velocity.},

In the Pacific Ocean the driftnet  controversy first emerged in the North Pacific transition  zone and subarctic frontal zone, where driftnet vessels  from Japan, the Republic of Korea, and Taiwan pursue  their target species of neon flying squid. Other North  Pacific driftnet fleets from Japan and Taiwan target stocks  of tunas and billfishes. Both types of driftnet fishing incidentally kill valued non-target species of marine life, including fish, mammals, birds, and turtles.    In response to public concerns about driftnet fishing,  government scientists began early on to assemble available  information and consider what new data were required to assess impacts on North Pacific marine resources and the broader pelagic ecosystem. Accordingly, a workshop was convened at the NMFS Honolulu Laboratory in May 1988 to review current information on the biology, oceanography, and fisheries of the North Pacific transition zone and subarctic frontal zone. The workshop participants, from the United States and Canada, also developed a strategic plan to guide NMFS in developing a program of driftnet fishery research and impact assessment.    This volume contains a selection of scientific review  papers presented at the 1988 Honolulu workshop. The  papers represent part of the small kernel of information  available then, prior to the expansion of cooperative international scientific programs. Subsequent driftnet fishery monitoring and research by the United States, Canada, Japan, Korea, and Taiwan have added much new data.  Nevertheless, this collection of papers provides a historical perspective and contains useful information not readily available elsewhere. (PDF file contains 118 pages.)},

Two water mass fronts, one overlying the other, are identified with a quasi-synoptic set of CfO-Ozand nutrient data from November 1986. In the warm water sphere we encounter North and South Atlantic Central Water (NACW/SACW) superimposed on extensions of Mediterranean outflow and Antarctic Intermediate Water. The Central Water Boundary, as the separator of NACW from SACW, represents the southeastern side of the CanaryfNorth Equatorial Current system . It acts as a barrier between the well-ventilated, nutrient-poor inner part of the basin-wide circulation of the North Atlantic and the shadow zone with its lowly oxygenated and nutrified cross-equatorial influx. Year-long current meter records, having fluctuations over typical time scales of 50-90 days, attest to the highly variable nature of the Cape Verde Frontal Zone. Incidentally. we observe in the data an intrathermocline eddy, called Meddy BIRGIT, which has a double maximum in the vertical salinity structure. Simultaneous Lagrangian observations by RICHARDSON et al . (19H9. Journal of Phy.tical Oceanography, 19,371-383) confirm the expected anticyclonic motion of this salt lens, which must have travelled without significant mixing for at least 2500 km from its likely generation region in the Gulf of Cadiz.},

This paper, centered on recent results from Geosat data, shows how satellite altimetry contributes to the description of oceanic mesoscale variability. The methods commonly used to extract the oceanic mesoscale signal are first recalled. We briefly discuss their impact on the signal, and measurement errors. We then look at the results of comparisons between altimeter data and in situ measurements, and demonstrate that Geosat data are suitable for observing mesoscale variability. The unique contribution which altimetry can make comes from its global space-time coverage, which provides a quasi-synoptic description of the ocean circulation and a statistical description to an unrivalled degree of detail. A few examples illustrate the innovative contribution which synoptic mapping can provide. But the greatest contribution is in the statistical description of ocean mesoscale variability. We review several papers dealing with the global statistical description of mesoscale variability and its seasonal variations, characterization of space and time scales and frequency-wave number spectral analysis, and statistical descriptions of western boundary currents. All confirm the unique contribution which satellite altimetry can make to the statistical description of mesoscale phenomena.},

  abstract = {Abstract Twenty-two years (1967{\textendash}88) of hydrographic data collected by the Japan Meteorological Agency along the 137{\textdegree}E meridian and surface wind data compiled by Florida State University (FSU) were analyzed to study the interannual variability in the western North Pacific. In the midlatitude region north of 22{\textdegree}N, the dominant signal in the dynamic height field was the interannual path variations of the Kuroshio. Whereas the eastward transport of the Kuroshio itself had no significant changes between the straight-path and meander-path years, the net transport of the Kuroshio system including recirculations showed a 30\% increase during the meander-path years. In the straight-path years when the net transport was small, the Kuroshio tended to take a straight path with a strong recirculation developed to the south. The interannual path variations of the Kuroshio strongly influenced the water-mass movement in the midlatitudes. During the Kuroshio meander years, we found that a significant portion of the North Pacific Intermediate Water east of the Kuroshio meander was blocked from subducting farther westward. In the middepth layer of 1500{\textendash}2500 m, analysis of the {\texttheta}{\textendash}S relation revealed a water-mass movement negatively correlated to the upper-layer Kuroshio path changes, implying a possible compensating flow in the middepth layer for the cold-core eddy emerging north of the Kuroshio. In the low-latitude region along 137{\textdegree}E, fluctuations in the surface height anomaly field had a meridionally coherent structure, and large surface height drops coincided with the ENSO events in the tropical Pacific. Accompanying the surface height drops in the ENSO years was an increase in the transport of both the North Equatorial Current (NEC) and the North Equatorial Countercurrent (NECC) and a southward shift in the boundary of the NEC and NECC. Based on the FSU surface wind data, we found that these interannual fluctuations of the NEC and the NECC were highly correlated to the Sverdrup transport fluctuations estimated from the basinwide wind-stress curl field. Using a reduced-gravity model and simplified patterns of wind forcing, we showed that this high correlation came about because the center of the interannual signal of the wind-stress curl field is close to the western Pacific (near the date line) and because the thermocline tilt in the NEC region attenuates the strong latitude dependence of the phase speed of the long baroclinic Rossby wave.},

  abstract = {The Loop Current penetrated deep into the Gulf of Mexico in early 1989. After several eddy formation and reattachment cycles, a southwestward propagating anticyclonic eddy was formed during the summer. The Loop Current and subsequent eddy produced strong currents over widespread areas on the Louisiana continental slope, prompting a series of current measurement programs. Because of the lack of satellite infrared coverage in the Gulf of Mexico during the summer, the trajectories of 53 ARGOS tracked drifting buoys deployed in the Gulf of Mexico in 1989 were assembled to determine the synoptic history of the Loop Current and anticyclonic eddy during this event. Ten of the most critical summertime buoy trajectories are discussed here. In addition, the trajectories of three of the buoys simultaneously deployed at different radii in the eddy were chosen for analysis with a kinematic feature model. The model assumes the looping buoy motion is generated by an elliptical orbit around a translating eddy center. The buoy trajectories were used to determine time series of the feature model parameters, including eddy center, shape and circulation characteristics. The time series results indicate that the eddy actually propagated in a series of short sprints separated by longer stalls. During the sprints, the eddy propagated as an elliptical but otherwise symmetric solid body. During the stalls, significant asymmetries developed. The asymmetries are consistent with attachment to the Loop Current during the first stall, the effects of topographic Rossby wave dispersion during the second, and the effects of planetary Rossby wave dispersion during the third. The results provide both a framework for the interpretation of in situ observations and a detailed evolutionary history for numerical modelers.},

  abstract = {Abstract Two candidate sources for the generation of mesoscale eddy activity in the California Current are local baroclinic instability and/or the wind stress adjacent to the coast. The latter constitutes remote forcing, with eddy activity propagating westward from the coast into the California Current via Rossby wave dynamics. In this study, two wind-driven models are utilized to test the relative significance of these two sources. One is an eddy resolving quasigeostrophic (QG) model, with the ability to represent baroclinic instability but not the coastal response to winds. The other is a 1{$\frac{1}{2}$}-layer primitive equation (PE) model with the ability to represent the coastal response to winds but not baroclinic instability. Both models have the same spatial grid (i.e., approximately 20 km) and are driven by the same coarse-grid wind-stress forcing fields over the same one-year time period (i.e., January 1987 to December 1987). This period is chosen because of the availability of Geosat altimetric sea-level observations with which to verify these models. Earlier, White and colleagues analyzed these same altimetric sea-level observations, finding dominant mesoscale eddy activity occurring on wavelength scales of 400{\textendash}800 km and period scales of 6{\textendash}12 months. This mesoscale variability propagates to the west at 2{\textendash}5 cm s-1, faster at lower latitude, consistent with Rossby wave dynamics. Moreover, the eddy variance is largest next to the coast, maximum between Monterey and Cape Mendocino, and southwest of Point Conception. The PE model is able to simulate qualitatively this distribution of the eddy variance as it appears in altimetric sea level, yielding significant coherence and phase between model and observed sea-level residuals along 1ongitude/time matrices at 30{\textdegree}N and 40{\textdegree}N. The QG model, on the other hand, is found incapable simulating the main features of this distribution of eddy variance. The reason for the agreement between the PE model and the satellite altimetric sea-level observations is that the dominant source of mesoscale eddy activity on these time and space scales is the wind forcing adjacent to the coast, modified by both Rossby and Kelvin wave dynamics.},

  abstract = {Abstract This paper describes a simple empirical analysis system based on Bratseth's method of successive corrections applied to detrended field data, which approximates an optimal interpolation of fields with a spatially variable mean sampled within a limited domain by scattered observations. As in other empirical interpolation schemes, the influence function that determines the weights applied to increment variables is chosen such that unresolvable scales tend to be strongly damped, even if the contribution from observation error is not represented in a formally equivalent correlation model for observed increment variables. Unlike most empirical successive correction schemes, the number of iterations is not necessarily considered as a prescribed analysis parameter. Instead, the number of iterations can be chosen on a judgemental, posterior basis such that the analysis approximates the observed field to within some acceptable limit. The analysis generated by this form of successive corrections can be represented by a continuous function of location variables. Consequently, it is possible to express the result of posterior filtering of the analysis field as a weighted sum of ``filtered'' influence functions, each of which is defined by the convolution of an increment autocorrelation function with a continuous linear filter. If both the autocorrelation model and filter are based on a simple Gaussian function of spatial lag, then these convolution integrals can be solved analytically. This leads to a numerically inexpensive method of scale selection analysis that is in some ways less ambiguous than methods based on applying filters directly to the observed data. The performance of the analysis system is demonstrated by applying it to simulated observations sampling two-dimensional fields.},

Horizontal dependency is emphasized because, in addition to vertical entrainment and surface thermal forcing, horizontal advection and eddy diffusion make substantial contributions to changes in the upper-ocean thermal structure in this region. By forcing the model using the wind and heat flux data from ECMWF and the absolute sea surface height data deduced from the Geosat ERM, the mixed-layer depth (hm) and temperature (Tm) changes in the Kuroshio Extension are hindcast for a 2.5-year period (November 1986{\textendash}April 1989). Both phase and amplitude of the modeled Tm and hm variations agreed well with the climatology. The horizontal thermal patterns also agreed favorably with the available in situ SST observations, but this agreement depended crucially on the inclusion of horizontal advections. Although the annually averaged net heat flux from the atmosphere to the ocean (Qnet) is negative over the Kuroshio Extension region, the effect of the surface thermal forcing, when integrated annually, is to increase Tm because the large, negative Qnet in winter is redistributed in a much deeper mixed layer than it is in summer when Qnet {$>$} 0. This warming effect is counterbalanced by the vertical turbulent entrainment through the base of the mixed layer (35\% when annually integrated), the Ekman divergence (16\%), the geostrophic divergence (12\%), and the horizontal eddy diffusion (35\%). Though small when averaged in space and time, the temperature advection by the surface flows makes a substantial contribution to the local heat balances. While it warms the upstream region of the Kuroshio Extension (west of 150{\textdegree}E), the current advection tends to cool the upper ocean over the vast downstream region due to the presence of the recirculation gyre.},

  abstract = {Abstract The subduction rate is calculated for the North Pacific based on Levitus climatology data and Hellerman and Rosenstein wind stress data. Because the period of effective subduction is rather short, subduction rates calculated in Eulerian and Lagrangian coordinates are very close. The subduction rate defined in the Lagrangian sense consists of two parts. The first part is due to the vertical pumping along the one-year trajectory, and the second part is due to the difference in the winter mixed layer depth over the one-year trajectory. Since the mixed layer is relatively shallow in the North Pacific, the vertical pumping term is very close to the Ekman pumping, while the sloping mixed layer base enhances subduction, especially near the Kuroshio Extension. For most of the subtropical North Pacific, the subduction rate is no more than 75 m yr-1, slightly larger than the Ekman pumping. The water mass volume and total amount of ventilation integrated for each interval of 0.2{$\sigma$} unit is computed. The corresponding renewal time for each water mass is obtained. The inferred renewal time is 5{\textendash}6 years for the shallow water masses ({$\sigma$} = 23.0{\textendash}25.0), and about 10 years for the subtropical mode water ({$\sigma$} = 25.2{\textendash}25.4). Within the subtropical gyre the total amount of Ekman pumping is 28.8 Sv (Sv {$\equiv$} 106 m3 s-1) and the total subduction rate is 33.1 Sv, which is slightly larger than the Ekman pumping rate. To this 33.1 Sv, the vertical pumping contributes 24.1 Sv and the lateral induction 9 Sv. The maximum barotropic mass flux of the subtropical gyre is about 46 Sv (cut of 135{\textdegree}E). This mass flux is partitioned as follows. The total horizontal mass flux in the ventilated thermocline, the seasonal thermocline, and the Ekman layer is about 30 Sv, and the remaining 16 Sv is in the unventilated thermocline. Thus, about one-third of the man flux in the wind-driven gyre is sheltered from direct air{\textendash}sea interaction.},

  abstract = {The altimetric data from the first 2.5-year Geosat Exact Repeat Mission were used to estimate the mean sea surface height (SSH) field in the region of the Gulf Stream and its recirculation gyres. Assuming the instantaneous surface velocity field is composed of an eastward flowing jet and two westward recirculating flows, we used the time-varying surface data from the altimeter to determine the shape of the along-track mean SSH profiles and the historical hydrographic data to constrain the net SSH difference across the Gulf Stream system. The two-dimensional mean SSH field was determined by objectively mapping the mean height profiles along the ascending and descending tracks. The SSH jump across the mean Gulf Stream has a maximum of 1.15m around 65{\textdegree}W and drops to an almost constant 0.9m downstream of the New England Seamount Chain (NESC). While the SSH jump associated with the mean northern recirculating flow is mostly uniform, we found that the Gulf Stream's southern recirculation has two local gyres that are separated by the NESC. An attempt was then made to estimate the mean deep circulation in this region by comparing the mean SSH field derived from the altimetry data and the surface dynamic height field based on the historical hydrographic data. Despite the large uncertainties, the mean deep flow pattern thus estimated agrees favorably with the overall circulation pattern from the long-term current meter observations. Like the well-defined northern recirculation gyre, we found that a continuous southward flow exists along 57.5{\textdegree}W, which follows closely along the deep layer potential vorticity contours. To the south of the Gulf Stream, the deep circulation consists of two separated recirculation gyres; the recirculation gyre to the east of the NESC appears to be trapped around the Corner Rise.},

Interannual geographical shifts of both the offshore Oyashiofront and saury fishing groundshad a dominant interdecadal fluctuation. In years when the offshore front shifted north (south), the fishing grounds were formed relatively nearshore (offshore). When the offshore front shifted north, the fishing grounds were formed further nearshore in years the coastal Oyashio intrusion extended south. When the offshore front shifted south, on the other hand, the southward extension of the coastal intrusion did not necessarily cause formation of coastal fishing grounds. These results showed that locations of the fishing groundsdepend not only on local and instantaneous oceanographic environments around the fishing grounds, but also on oceanographic conditions over an extensive range of the Oyashio area. This might indicate that the ecology of the saury's northward migration, through mixed water regions between the Kuroshio and Oyashio fronts in spring and summer, has a close relation to the shift of the offshore Oyashio front over a time range of months. A practical forecasting method for locations of saury fishing grounds is proposed based on the oceanography before the fishing season.},

  abstract = {Abstract The variations of the Kuroshio Current path and their relations with current velocity, volume transport, and upstream position of the Kuroshio are examined using sea level data. After the long-time, non-large-meander (NLM) path during 1963{\textendash}75, the Kuroshio takes a large-meander (LM) path during most of 1975{\textendash}91: 1975{\textendash}80, 1981{\textendash}84, 1986{\textendash}88, and 1989{\textendash}91. The study of these meanders confirms the description of the path of the Kuroshio based on the three typical paths and the transitions between them, with an exception being the 1981{\textendash}84 LM path. The formation and decay of the large meander are associated with velocity and position of the Kuroshio in the Tokara Strait south of Kyushu. A small meander, precursor of the large meander, seems to be formed southeast of Kyushu in relation with a temporary increase of Kuroshio velocity and a northward shift of the Kuroshio in the Tokara Strait. An eastward propagation of the small meander, leading to the LM formation, is associated with remaining in the northern position in the Tokara Strait, but not with large velocity except in 1975. Decay of the large meander occurs associated with large velocity and a return to the southern position of the Kuroshio in the Tokara Strait. Unusual separation of a cold eddy from the LM path is also related with a temporary increase of Kuroshio velocity. Volume transport of the Kuroshio shows an interdecadal variation, small before 1975 and large afterward, that is, the transport during the 1975{\textendash}91 LM-dominant period is larger on average than that during the 1963{\textendash}75 NLM path. All the LM paths are formed when the transport increases from about 24 Sv (Sv = 106 m3 s-1), while the Kuroshio takes an NLM path whenever the transport is less than 23.5 Sv. Velocity of the Kuroshio main current is mostly correlated with the transport but is different in the decrease after 1981. This shows that the Kuroshio always takes a NLM path for small transport and velocity, but can take either path for their large and medium ranges. A factor for determining the path in these ranges is the position of the Kuroshio in the Tokara Strait; LM paths begin and terminate about four months after the Kuroshio shifts to the north and returns to the south, respectively. The time lags are for the formation and decay processes. In conclusion, LM paths occur when the Kuroshio has large or medium transport and velocity, and is in a northern position in the Tokara Strait. The northern position implies a small curvature and a large vertical inclination of current axis south of Kyushu, which may be related with the dynamics of a large meander.},

  abstract = {Abstract The assimilation of temperature and altimetric velocity into a numerical model of the upper-ocean mixed layer in Part I allowed an analysis of the upper ocean heat budget for the western North Atlantic Ocean over the 2.5-year period of the Geosat Exact Repeat Mission (November 1986{\textendash}April 1989). The balance of terms varied regionally: south of the Gulf Stream advection was relatively unimportant in the heat budget, and the ocean responded passively to changes in surface flux. Within the Gulf Stream and to the north of it, cooling of the upper ocean by advection was as large as 0.15{\textdegree}C/day for periods of several weeks. An analysis of the advection term showed that cooling by Ekman transport was opposed by warming from the geostrophic currents of the Gulf Stream, with cooling typically stronger by a factor of 2 because nonuniform Ekman transport disrupted the normal alignment between isotherms and sea surface height contours. There is a complex ocean-atmosphere coupling in this region: in addition to its increase during strong wind events, warming by geostrophic currents is a function of the strength of the Gulf Stream and its recirculation gyres. Over the 2.5-year period, the winds became progressively stronger, causing an increase in cooling by Ekman transport. Advective cooling was balanced by an increasingly positive surface flux (warming of the ocean by the atmosphere) at the rate of about 20\% of the annually averaged surface flux per year. This positive trend in the surface flux was also observed in the estimates from the atmospheric general circulation model of the ECMWF.},

  abstract = {Abstract Ventilation in the North Atlantic and North Pacific is examined by analyzing the Levitus climatological data and the Hellerman and Rosenstein wind stress data. Ventilation between the permanent pycnocline and the overlying seasonal pycnocline and mixed layer consists of two physical processes: subduction and obduction. Subduction takes place mainly in the subtropical basin where surface water is irreversibly transferred into the permanent pycnocline below. Obduction takes place in the subpolar basin where water from the permanent pycnocline is irreversibly transferred into the mixed layer above. Veatilation in the North Atlantic and North Pacific can be clarified into four physically different regions: the subductive region, the obductive region, the ambiductive region where both subduction and obduction take place, and the insulated region where neither subduction nor obduction occurs. Although the total subduction rates in these two oceans are comparable, the total obduction rates are considerably different. In the North Atlantic, obduction is strong (23.5 Sv), consistent with the notion of the fast thermohaline circulation and the relatively short renewal time of the subpolar water masses in the Atlantic basin. Obduction is weak in the North Pacific (7.8 Sv), this is consistent with the sluggish thermohaline circulation and the slower renewal process of the subpolar water masses there. Accordingly, the water mass renewal time based on the subduction/obduction rate is calculated and compared with previous estimations.},

To separate the time-dependent (SSH) signals associated with the Kuroshio Extension from those associated with the westward recirculating flows, and to study the energetics of these currents, the author first estimated the mean SSH profiles along individual ground tracks by assuming the velocity profile of the Kuroshio Extension to be Gaussian shaped and by successively fitting the synthetic current's height profile to the time-dependent SSH data. The mean SSH field, including the influence from the recirculating flows, is then derived through the constraint from climatological hydrographic data. During the 21-month period of the TOPEX mission, the eddy kinetic energy (EKE) of the Kuroshio Extension had relatively uniform values during three separate stages, each of which lasted longer than 6 months. A significant drop in the EKE level is found in the Kuroshio Extension after the end of 1993. In contrast, the EKE level in the southern recirculation region increased steadily over the two-year period. The energetics analysis shows that this EKE increase is due to the energy transfers from the mean flow field to the eddy field through barotropic instabilities. These barotropic eddy processes are found to be less important for the EKE changes in the Kuroshio Extension and its northern areas. On both seasonal and interannual timescales, the large-scale path fluctuations of the Kuroshio Extension are found to correlate significantly with the surface transport fluctuations: a more northerly Kuroshio Extension tends to correspond to a larger surface transport. Over the two-year period, both the eastward-flowing Kuroshio Extension and the westward recirculating flows weakened steadily. This decline in the intensity of the recirculation gyre is caused by the energy transfers from the mean flow field to the eddy field occurring in the region south of the Kuroshio Extension.},

A gyre-scale scheme of STMW circulation is deduced based on its observed climatological formation area and climatological geostrophic flow fields. The deduced circulation is supported by climatological features of the subsurface hydrography presented separately for the non-large-meander period and the large-meander period of the Kuroshio: zonal and meridional sections and isopycnal maps of potential vorticity and apparent oxygen utilization. The Kuroshio Countercurrent composing the Kuroshio recirculation system advects STMW formed in the wintertime thick mixed layer immediately off the Kuroshio and the Kuroshio Extension. During the non-large-meander period, the recirculation system has a single anticyclonic gyre centered near 30{\textdegree}N, 137{\textdegree}E and advects STMW formed off the Kuroshio Extension, or east of 140{\textdegree}E, to the meridian of 137{\textdegree}E south of Honshu within a few months. Heavier STMW formed farther east is advected along an outer path, taking several months longer. During the large-meander period, the recirculation system is separated into two anticyclonic gyres west and east of 140{\textdegree}E, and no substantial westward advection of STMW across the 140{\textdegree}E meridian occurs, while minor advection of STMW along the outer path can occur. The climatological hydrography also suggests that the STMW formed in one winter will be dissipated considerably within a year or so.},

  abstract = {Abstract The North Pacific Intermediate Water (NPIW) originates as a vertical salinity minimum in the mixed water region (MWR) between the Kuroshio and Oyashio, just east of Japan. Salinity minima in this region are examined and related to the water man structures, dynamical features, and winter mixed layer density of waters of Oyashio origin. Stations in the MWR are divided into five regimes, of which three represent source waters (from the Kuroshio, Oyashio, and Tsugaru Current) and two are mixed waters formed from these three inputs. Examination of NPIW at stations just east of the MWR indicates that the mixed waters in the MWR are the origin of the newest NPIW. Multiple salinity minima with much finestructure are seen throughout the MWR in spring 1989, with the most fragmented occurring around the large warm core ring centered at 37{\textdegree}N, 144{\textdegree}E, suggesting that this is a dominant site for salinity minimum formation. The density of the NPIW in the MWR is slightly higher than the apparent late winter surface density of the subpolar water. It is hypothesized that the vertical mixing that creates interfacial layers above the salinity minima also increases the density of the minima to the observed NPIW density. Transport of new intermediate water (26.65{\textendash}27.4 {$\sigma\theta$}) eastward out of the MWR is about 6 Sv (Sv{$\equiv$}106 m3 s-1), of which roughly 45\% is of Oyashio origin and the other 55\% of Kuroshio origin. Therefore. the transport of subpolar water into the subtropical gyre in the western North Pacific is estimated to be about 3 Sv.},

In particular it is difficult to determine from observations what role energetic mesoscale eddies play in poleward heat transport. In place of missing long-term buoy measurements over extensive areas, eddy resolving numerical ocean circulation simulations offer some means to gain insight. For ocean models with specified meridional density distributions at the upper boundary it is possible to compare the poleward heat transport in eddy resolving and non-eddyresolving simulations. While a change of vertical diffusion in models is known to be very important for poleward heat transport, the reduction of horizontal viscosity and diffusion, which allows mesoscale eddies to appear in the simulation, seems to have little effect. A possible explanation appears to be that the models for normal parameter ranges are very weakly driven thermal systems. The time dependent mesoscale eddies appear to set up nearly adiabatic flows in which eddy transport of heat is compensated by induced mean flows which transport heat in the opposite direction. For extremely strong forcing of the density field in the upper ocean this is no longer true.},

The overall eddy variability during the 26-month experiment was dominated by six large amplitude trough formation events, with each event lasting approximately one month. To determine the source(s) of energy for this eddy variability, the eddy energy budget is evaluated. Traditionally, the baroclinic conversion of mean potential energy to eddy potential energy is defined as a downgradient heat flux. However, because a nondivergent heat flux can be downgradient even under conditions in which there is no barolinic conversion occurring, a better, more dynamically correct definition of a baroclinic conversion rate is a downgradient horizontally divergent heat flux. The horizontally divergent heat flux component is estimated to be approximately half the full horizontal heat flux vector. Nevertheless, the resulting ``dynamical'' baroclinic conversion rate is found to be positive and nearly an order of magnitude larger than the weakly positive barotropic conversion rate. Because the large troughs at 68{\textdegree}W are formed through a baroclinic conversion process, the Gulf Stream jet is judged to be baroclinically unstable at 68{\textdegree}W.},

The study region at 68{\textdegree}W is characterized by large amplitude trough formation events. It is shown that Ftherm is associated with the growth stage of the eddy trough formation events and tends to turn the upper-level time-mean flow southward into the trough pattern and accelerate and ``spin up'' the deep-layer cyclone; Fmom has a vertically coherent pattern associated with the decay stage of the trough formation events and tends to offset Ftherm particularly in the deep layer.},

  abstract = {Abstract A simultaneous assimilation model of drifting buoy and altimetric data is proposed to determine the mean sea surface height (SSH) as well as the temporal evolution of the surface circulation on synoptic scales. To demonstrate the efficiency of our assimilation model, several identical twin experiments for the double-gyre circulation system are performed using a 11/2-layer primitive equation model. An optimal interpolation for the multivariate is used for the assimilation scheme that assumes the geostrophic relationship between the error fields of the velocity and the interface depth. To identify the nature of the assimilation of the buoy-derived velocities into the dynamical ocean model, the authors first conduct the assimilation experiment using the drifting buoy data alone. The result shows that realistic buoy deployment (32 in a 40{\textdegree} square) can effectively constrain the model variables; that is, both the absolute (mean plus time varying) velocity and SSH (interface depth) fields are significantly improved by this buoy data assimilation. Moreover, in the case of denser buoy deployment in the energetic western boundary current regions, where the mean SSH is comparable to the time-varying part and the geoid error is relatively large, the assimilation provides a better determination of the absolute velocity and SSH. This is because significant changes in the mean SSH lead to an improvement along the extensive buoy trajectories associated with the strong current. It is worth noting that the assimilation of drifting buoy data is more effective than that of moored velocity data, thanks to the Lagrangian information content of the drifting buoys. Successive correction of the mean SSH is made with simultaneous assimilation of drifting buoy and altimetric data. Consequently, a better correction of the mean SSH is obtained: The initial error of the mean SSH is reduced by approximately 40\% after the 1-year experiment. In contrast, the assimilation experiment of altimetric data alone corrects only the time-varying part, but yields little error reduction for the mean SSH in our model. These results clearly show that the simultaneous assimilation of drifting buoy and altimetric data into the dynamical model is a very useful tool for improving the model's realism.},

Despite the short data records, approximately 2.5 years, correlation analyses of nonseasonal fluctuations showed similar relationships for both oceans. Correlations between the height difference across the jets (surface transport) and the path of the western boundary currents suggested that there is a structural change of the recirculation gyres, associated with a path change, with timescales of 5{\textendash}9 months. Both wind stress and wind stress curl were clearly correlated with the surface transport and path in each ocean. Although net surface heat flux and wind stress were correlated, there was no clear correlation between net surface heat flux from ECMWF and surface transport over the entire study region. Additional regional analyses of the North Atlantic showed a consistent relationship between cooling, sea surface temperature (SST), and surface transport west of 62{\textdegree}W; anomalous cooling (accompanied by cyclonic wind anomalies) corresponds to a weaker SST gradient across the Gulf Stream and decreasing surface transport. Because the surface transport fluctuations to the west and east of 62{\textdegree}W in the western North Atlantic are not correlated, structural changes in the recirculation gyres, which have their maximum variations east of 62{\textdegree}W, may not be related to surface heat flux variations.},

  abstract = {Abstract A primitive equation Gulf of Mexico model was used to examine variability of the Loop Current (LC) and Loop Current eddies (LCE). Realistic results were obtained for a certain range of values of the horizontal mixing coefficient: eddy paths were west and southwestward; eddy propagation speeds from 3 to 5 km day-1; the ratio of minor to major eddy axes about 0.8; eddy shedding periods from 200 to 500 days; eddy lifetimes from 100 to 200 days; eddy sizes from 200 to 400 km; and eddy swirl transports, as fractions of the specified inflow of 30 Sv, were from 0.55 to 0.85. On the other hand, the maximum vertical deepening of the 20{\textdegree}C isotherm was 15\% to 50\% less than that observed, resulting in weaker near-surface currents of about 0.65 m s-1, in comparison to observed values of 0.88 to 1.7 m s-1. A strong correlation between eddy shedding and decreasing or reversing lower-layer (below 750 m) transport in the Yucatan Channel is found. In the western Gulf, current variability is produced by eddy arrivals, as well as by forcing due to bottom-intensified topographic Rossby waves, which propagate along the slope from the east with a group velocity of about 12 km day-1 and periods of about 30{\textendash}100 days. These waves are generally preceded by faster coastally trapped wave propagation, and all are produced by LC pulsation, eddy shedding, and westward propagation.},

Transport estimate suggests that the new NPIW bifurcates into the interfrontal zone and into the recirculation of the subtropical gyre. A salinity minimum structure can he also created due to the isopycnal mixing along the Kuroshio Extension between the Oyashio and Kuroshio waters, which have different salinity and vertical velocity structures. The low-salinity Oyashio water seen along the Oyashio branches and the Kuroshio Extension has low potential vorticity (Q={$\rho-$}1f{$\delta\rho$}/{$\delta$}z), suggesting that NPIW formation is primarily density driven due to sinking in the Okhotsk Sea.},

The model transport variations across the PN line are also almost the same as the observation; the transport shows a weak maximum in summer and a weak minimum in winter.

  abstract = {Abstract Planetary or Rossby waves are the predominant way in which the ocean adjusts on long (year to decade) timescales. The motion of long planetary waves is westward, at speeds {$\geq$}1 cm s-1. Until recently, very few experimental investigations of such waves were possible because of scarce data. The advent of satellite altimetry has changed the situation considerably. Curiously, the speeds of planetary waves observed by TOPEX/Poseidon are mainly faster than those given by standard linear theory. This paper examines why this should be. It is argued that the major changes to the unperturbed wave speed will be caused by the presence of baroclinic east{\textendash}west mean flows, which modify the potential vorticity gradient. Long linear perturbations to such flow satisfy a simple eigenvalue problem (related directly to standard quasigeostrophic theory). Solutions are mostly real, though a few are complex. In simple situations approximate solutions can be obtained analytically. Using archive data, the global problem is treated. Phase speeds similar to those observed are found in most areas, although in the Southern Hemisphere an underestimate of speed by the theory remains. Thus, the presence of baroclinic mean flow is sufficient to account for the majority of the observed speeds. It is shown that phase speed changes are produced mainly by (vertical) mode-2 east{\textendash}west velocities, with mode-1 having little or no effect. Inclusion of the mean barotropic flow from a global eddy-admitting model makes only a small modification to the fit with observations; whether the fit is improved is equivocal.},

Here, the time-mean subduction of a water mass, evaluated following the meandering surface density outcrops, is found to incorporate a rectified contribution from eddies, arising from correlations between the area over which the water mass is outcropped at the sea surface and the local subduction rate. Alternatively, this eddy subduction can be interpreted in terms of an eddy-driven secondary circulation associated with baroclinic instability. The net subduction rate, incorporating both Eulerian-mean and eddy contributions, can be further related to buoyancy forcing of the surface mixed layer using a formula by Walin (1982). Solutions from an idealized two-dimensional ocean model are presented to illustrate the eddy contribution to subduction rates in the Southern Ocean and in an open-ocean convective chimney. In the Southern Ocean, the net subduction rate is the residual of the Eulerian-mean and eddy contributions, which cancel at leading order; given plausible patterns of surface buoyancy forcing, one can obtain subduction of Antarctic Intermediate Water and Antarctic Bottom Water, with entrainment of North Atlantic Deep Water in between. In a convective chimney, in contrast, the Eulerian-mean subduction rate is vanishingly small and the subduction is contributed entirely by mesoscale eddies.},

  abstract = {The classical question of what happens when anomalous water enters an ocean via a meridional northward channel is addressed analytically using a reduced-gravity nonlinear model. The channel corresponds to either a conduit connecting 2 otherwise separated basins (e.g., the Yucatan Channel) or a conduit carrying water from an independent source. The traditional view is that, due to the Coriolis force, such an anomalous northward flowing current turns to the right (looking offshore) and forms a zonal boundary current that flows eastward. In this scenario, a front (corresponding to a surfacing interface) separates the oceanic and the anomalous water. Integration of the steady inviscid momentum equation along the boundary gives the long-shore flow-force and shows that such a scenario leads to a paradox. Specifically, such a flow corresponds to an unbalanced flow-force and, therefore, cannot exist. To balance the integrated momentum and resolve the paradox the inflow constantly sheds anticyclones which propagate to the left due to {$\beta$}. Under such conditions, the momentum of the eddies moving to the left balances the momentum of the current flowing to the right. This new eddy shedding mechanism may explain why the Loop Current produces loops and why other inflows produce anticyclones. A nonlinear analytical solution to the problem is constructed with the aid of a new and powerful theoretical approach which is based on the idea that, after each eddy generation process, the system returns to its original state. This implies that nonlinear periodic flows can be integrated over a control volume in a similar manner to the integration used in steady flows. This novel method enables us to extract the details of the resulting features (i.e., their size, speed, periodicity and depth of the shedded rings) without solving for the details of the incredibly complicated three-dimensional and time-dependent generation process. It turns out that the problem involves a new eddy length scaleRd/{$\epsilon$}1/6 (where Rd is the parent current Rossby radius and {$\epsilon$} = {$\beta$}Rd/f0) which is somewhat greater than that of most eddies. Calculations were made for both zero and finite potential vorticity flows; they show that, for currents such as the Loop Current which transports about 20 Sv, eddies are shed approximately once every 300 days. Quantitative numerical experiments using the Bleck and Boudra model show that, indeed, an inflow along a straight coastline produces eddies next to the source.},

It originates as a northern branch of westward moving interior flow and flows coherently along the islands at an average speed of 0.10{\textendash}0.15 m sϪ1. The NHRC veers westward at the northern tip of the Hawaiian Islands, and its subsequent path is not influenced by the presence of the submerged Hawaiian Ridge. This finding does not support the theory that the NHRC is forced by westward propagating, baroclinic Rossby waves reflecting off the Hawaiian Ridge. Using a 2{$\frac{1}{2}$}-layer reduced gravity model of the North Pacific, it is shown that the mean NHRC is due primarily to the mean rather than the time-varying wind forcing. The NHRC exists due to the imbalance between the interior Sverdrup transport and the net southward transport, constrained by the presence of the Hawaiian Islands. The path and transport of the observed NHRC are found to be consistent with the flow pattern proposed by this theory.},

By explicitly estimating the decay scale for the long baroclinic Rossby wave, the authors show that the forced wave patterns at all off-equatorial regions appear to propagate westward at 2cr, where cr is the phase speed of the long baroclinic wave. The presence of the boundary-generated, free Rossby waves in the low latitudes, however, reinforces the 1cr phase propagation in the combined height anomaly fields. Toward higher latitudes, this reinforcement weakens as the boundary-generated, free waves become highly dissipative; as a result, the forced wave motion becomes more dominant, which works to increase the apparent phase speed up to 2cr. In the subpolar regions where the annual baroclinic Rossby waves become evanescent, an apparent phase speed higher than 2cr is observed when an annual, standing wave response and a propagating wave response with an interannual frequency coexist. Stronger annual and interannual wind fluctuations over the Southern Hemisphere subpolar regions than over the Northern Hemisphere subpolar regions suggest that this coupling, and the phase speed higher than 2cr, are more likely to be detected in the Southern Hemisphere subpolar oceans.},

The NPCMW thermostad lies centered around 160{\textdegree}W between the Kuroshio Extension and the Kuroshio bifurcation front. Its local core temperature ranges from 10{\textdegree} to 13{\textdegree}C with a somewhat zonally elongated pattern, in contrast to the more uniform core temperature at 16{\textdegree}{\textendash}17{\textdegree}C of the NPSTMW thermostad lying centered at 150{\textdegree}{\textendash}160{\textdegree}E south of the Kuroshio Extension. The climatological map of the wintertime mixed layer thickness together with sea surface temperature distribution indicates that the NPCMW formation area is likely situated south of the Kuroshio bifurcation front and at 175{\textdegree}E{\textendash}160{\textdegree}W extending as far south as about 37{\textdegree}N around 170{\textdegree}W. The climatological geostrophic flow field suggests that the NPCMW thermostad is spread from its formation area by the North Pacific Current flowing primarily eastward with relatively small southward velocity, which is contrasted with the NPSTMW thermostad spread within the anticyclonic Kuroshio recirculation region and explains the rather zonally elongated temperature distribution of NPCMW. The NPCMW formation can be fit into the recent estimation of the subduction rate of the main thermocline, coinciding with the region of the moderate subduction rate dominated by the lateral induction term.},

  abstract = {To produce an interpretation of the surface kinetic energy as measured by altimeters, a survey is made of the vertical structure of kinetic energy profiles in a large number of globally distributed long current meter records. Although the data are geographically confined primarily to a latitude band in the North Pacific, to the North Atlantic, and to a few moorings in the South Atlantic, the results show, generally speaking, that most regions are dominated by the barotropic and first baroclinic modes. Because of the near-surface intensification of baroclinic modes altimeters primarily reflect the first baroclinic mode, and thus the motion of the main thermocline. There is good quantitative agreement, with a few exceptions, with estimates of the surface kinetic energy obtained from the TOPEX/POSEIDON altimeter and from vertical extrapolations to the surface of the mooring profiles. These results are consistent with previous suggestions that barotropic models have little skill in depicting variability as seen in the altimeter data. An EOF analysis is shown to produce fictitious mode coupling unless the dynamical modes have very different energy levels.},

In the Okhotsk Sea Kuril Basin a pycnostad (referred to as the Okhotsk Sea Mode Water (OSMW)) was found in the density range of 26.6{\textendash}27 {$\sigma\theta$}. The pycnostad is not seen in the Western Subarctic Gyre (WSAG); thus it is an indicative water peculiar to the Okhotsk Sea. The maximum thickness is at 26.7{\textendash}26.9 {$\sigma\theta$} (centered at 26.8 {$\sigma\theta$}) which coincides with the NPIW density range in the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre. In the Oyashio area east of the southern Kuril Islands and Hokkaido, waters that have intermediate temperature, salinity, and potential vorticity between the OSMW and the WSAG water were distributed, suggesting a following transport route of the NPIW source water. The thick (thus low-Q; Q is potential vorticity) and low-salinity water mass outflowing from the Okhotsk Sea mixes with the relatively warm, saline, and high-Q WSAG water to form the Oyashio water. A coastal part of the Oyashio water flows southwestward along the east coast of the southern Kuril Islands and Hokkaido, retaining the pycnostad (Q minimum). A large part of the low-Q Oyashio water flows further southward and merges with the Kuroshio Extension and then flows eastward, forming new NPIW. In this process a salinity minimum develops and the Q minimum disappears because of the mixing with a saline Kuroshio water (old NPIW) without a pycnostad in the NPIW density range. These results suggest that the origin of NPIW is the water mass in the Okhotsk Sea (OSMW) and the density of the water mass primarily determines the NPIW density centered at around 26.8 {$\sigma\theta$}.},

  abstract = {Abstract Recent altimetric observations of the ocean surface reveal signatures of long planetary waves near the annual frequency band. Comparisons of the observed wave speeds and those predicted by standard linear theory suggest that the latter is inadequate as it yields different westward speeds than those measured; in the extratropical latitudes the predicted speeds are typically slower than the observations. Here the problem of long, baroclinic wave propagation in a forced, stratified ocean is considered theoretically with a view toward explaining these observations of ``too fast'' planetary waves. From a quasigeostrophic analysis, it is argued that baroclinic waves in a sheared environment are accelerated to the west via their interactions with both the mean advective field and the mean potential vorticity field. Conditions under which the ratio of actual to linear phase speeds matches the observed ratio are computed and found to be typical of the open ocean. Extensions of these ideas to continuously stratified quasigeostrophic and layered planetary geostrophic systems are discussed.},

If a resting ocean of horizontally uniform stratification is subject to spatially uniform buoyancy loss at the sea surface, then gravitational instability ensues in which buoyancy is drawn from depth by upright convection. But if spatial inhomogeneities in the ambient stratification or the forcing are present (as always exist in nature), then horizontal density gradients will be induced and, within a rotation period, horizontal currents in thermal-wind balance with those gradients will be set up within the mixed layer. There are two important consequences on the convective process: 1) Upright convection will become modified by the presence of the thermal wind shear; fluid parcels are exchanged not along vertical paths but, rather, along slanting paths in symmetric instability. Theoretical considerations suggest that this slantwise convection sets the potential vorticity of the mixed layer fluid to zero but, in general, will leave it stably stratified in the vertical.},

The wind-driven gyre in the South Pacific is relatively deep, reaching 2.4 km along the southern edge of the gyre. The gross feature of subduction obtained from both the data analysis and the analytical model is similar, with an annual ventilation rate of 21.6 Sv (Sv {$\epsilon$} 106 m3 sϪ1), including 18.1 Sv from vertical pumping and 3.5 Sv from lateral induction. Although the annual subduction rate in the South Pacific is comparable to that in the North Atlantic, lack of localized subduction leads to relatively weak mode water formation in the region where the East Australian Current separates from its western boundary. In addition, results from the analytical model indicate the existence of an isopycnal slope reversal in the southeastern Pacific.},

  abstract = {Sea surface temperatures and sea surface slopes, measured by the ERS-I satellite, are used to investigate the propagation of mesoscale features in the Southern Ocean. The Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) is clearly identifiable as a region of eastward propagation surrounded by mostly westward propagation. This confirms predictions based on results from the Fine Resolution Antarctic Model, which suggest that the ACC is a region of flow which is supercritical with respect to the propagation of baroclinic Rossby waves. This supercriticality allows the ACC to penetrate deep enough to interact with bottom topography and so may be an important part of the mechanism by which the current achieves a balance of angular momentum. The propagation directions derived from the two independent data sources agree in remarkable detail, and many dynamical features can be identified, including the South Atlantic Current and the Tasman Front. The wavelengths calculated using the two data sets are quite sensitive to details of the processing. While this means they can be said to be ``not inconsistent,'' the relationship between temperature gradients and slopes demands further investigation. The results on direction of propagation, however, are robust.},

Scaling arguments suggest two parameters that dictate the effective strength of the slope: the first indicates the likelihood of dispersion at depth, and the second relates to baroclinic stability. If the deep flow is only weakly dispersive (weak slopes), an initially barotropic vortex can translate barotropically across the isobaths, provided the vortex scale exceeds the deformation scale. Over stronger slopes, the vortex separates into topographic waves and a stationary, surface-trapped vortex. An initially surface-trapped vortex larger than deformation scale becomes unstable over a weak slope, as it does over a flat bottom. However, a strong slope can stabilize the vortex to small perturbations, despite the large vortex scale. The effective slope parameters depend not only on topographic grade, but on vortex strength and size, and on the ambient stratification. Parameters obtained with representative oceanic values suggest that topographically induced vertical decoupling may be quite common.},

Using this method, the round-trip traveltime measurement of the IES can be calibrated into various dynamic quantities with better accuracy than was possible with previous methods. For a set of four IES records from the Newfoundland Basin, the estimate of the accuracy of the geopotential height anomaly (integrated between 100 and 4000 db) calibrated from the IES measurements was reduced from 0.65 to 0.52 m2 sϪ2, which is a substantial reduction toward the intrinsic scatter of the geopotential height anomaly versus travel-time relationship for this region (0.42 m2 sϪ2). The addition of the pressure sensor to the IES results in reduced errors and eliminates the need for coincident CTD measurements. Moreover, the pressure sensor provides a complementary dataset recording the changes of the barotropic pressure field.},

  abstract = {Without deep mixing, the ocean would turn, within a few thousand years, into a stagnant pool of cold salty water with equilibrium maintained locally by near-surface mixing and with very weak convectively driven surface-intensified circulation. (This result follows from Sandstr{\"o}m's theorem for a fluid heated and cooled at the surface.) In this context we revisit the 1966 ``Abyssal Recipes'', which called for a diapycnal diffusivity of 10-4m2/s (1cgs) to maintain the abyssal stratification against global upwelling associated with 25Sverdrups of deep water formation. Subsequent microstructure measurements gave a pelagic diffusivity (away from topography) of 10-5m2/s {\textemdash} a low value confirmed by dye release experiments. A new solution (without restriction to constant coefficients) leads to approximately the same values of global upwelling and diffusivity, but we reinterpret the computed diffusivity as a surrogate for a small number of concentrated sources of buoyancy flux (regions of intense mixing) from which the water masses (but not the turbulence) are exported into the ocean interior. Using the Levitus climatology we find that 2.1TW (terawatts) are required to maintain the global abyssal density distribution against 30Sverdrups of deep water formation. The winds and tides are the only possible source of mechanical energy to drive the interior mixing. Tidal dissipation is known from astronomy to equal 3.7 TW (2.50{$\pm$}0.05TW from M2 alone), but nearly all of this has traditionally been allocated to dissipation in the turbulent bottom boundary layers of marginal seas. However, two recent TOPEX/POSEIDON altimetric estimates combined with dynamical models suggest that 0.6{\textendash}0.9TW may be available for abyssal mixing. A recent estimate of wind-driving suggests 1TW of additional mixing power. All values are very uncertain. A surprising conclusion is that the equator-to-pole heat flux of 2000TW associated with the meridional overturning circulation would not exist without the comparatively minute mechanical mixing sources. Coupled with the findings that mixing occurs at a few dominant sites, there is a host of questions concerning the maintenance of the present climate state, but also that of paleoclimates and their relation to detailed continental configurations, the history of the Earth{\textendash}Moon system, and a possible great sensitivity to details of the wind system.},

New statistical significance tests for wavelet power spectra are developed by deriving theoretical wavelet spectra for white and red noise processes and using these to establish significance levels and confidence intervals. It is shown that smoothing in time or scale can be used to increase the confidence of the wavelet spectrum. Empirical formulas are given for the effect of smoothing on significance levels and confidence intervals.

  abstract = {East Asian cold-air outbreaks, accompanied by increasing surface pressure (`pressure surges'), are shown to be an important aspect of the subseasonal variability of the winter monsoon system. In this study the statistical linear relationship between pressure surges, tropical convection, and tropospheric circulation is assessed using a ten-year data set (1985/86-1994/95) of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts gridded operational analyses. From spectral analysis the pressure, wind, and temperature fluctuations indicative of strong pressure surges are found to have statistically-significant spectral peaks at submonthly periods (6 to 30 days). Linear regression analysis is used to detail the time evolution of the dominant horizontal and vertical structure of east Asian pressure surges. Surges are shown to relate significantly to circulation anomalies in both the meridional and zonal components of the lower-tropospheric wind. Relationships between east Asian pressure surges in the submonthly band and tropical circulation anomalies are found over the Bay of Bengal, the eastern Indian Ocean, Indonesia, and the western Pacific regions. Submonthly surges over the South China Sea are related to strong surges and convective activity south of Indonesia, over the South China Sea, the eastern Indian Ocean, and the Philippine regions. Surge-enhanced convective activity is found to precede an enhancement of the local east Asian Hadley cell. Submonthly surges over the Philippine Sea are related to periods of westerly-wind anomalies and convective activity in the western Pacific. Upper-level wave activity over western Asia precedes submonthly surges. The wave activity amplifies in the region of the Pacific jet stream, and can be traced dispersing equatonvard through the region of upper-level westerlies over the eastern tropical Pacific.},

The analysis used orbit parameters derived from a least square fit of a translating ellipse kinematic model and showed that paths from four quite different eddies had a number of similar features. They are a general increase in rotational period over time, clockwise rotation of ellipse axes that slows with time and often becomes stationary in the far western Gulf, swirl velocities that decay quite slowly, and a tendency of the eddies to have low divergence. In three cases, 20- to 30-day oscillations of the orbit parameters were observed. Translation velocities of the orbits showed the characteristic stalls and sprints that have been previously observed. In two cases, stalls and deviations from solid body rotation could be attributed to the presence of vigorous lower continental slope cyclones situated to the northwest of the eddies in question. Comparison of relative vorticity, calculated from orbits and hydrography, showed reasonable agreement though deviations from solid body rotation were found in all cases. Vorticity also remained fairly constant for the 3{\textendash}6-month periods investigated. Major perturbations were tentatively attributed to absorption of weaker, older Loop Current anticyclones in the western Gulf.},

  abstract = {In January 1993, two Agulhas rings were sampled in the eastern South Atlantic during the World Ocean Circulation Experiment one-time hydrographic section A11. The first of these, Ring 1, was sampled at 36{\textdegree}S, 4{\textdegree}E in the Subtropical Frontal Zone and was smaller and less energetic than other, more typical Agulhas rings, owing partly to its interactions with the North Subtropical Front. The other, Ring 2, was sampled at 33{\textdegree}S, 10{\textdegree}E in the subtropics. This ring was average in size and reasonably representative of the rings observed in the southeast Atlantic during the early 1990s. The path of the rings is found to be dominated by advection in the mean flow rather than self-induced velocities of eddies under the {$\beta$} effect. We observe significant differences in reduced gravity and available heat and salt anomalies in the rings; from these we infer temporal variability in the stratification of rings upon their formation at the Agulhas Retroflection. This temporal variability in the structure of rings will affect the fluxes associated with them. Data collected within Ring 2 show that neglecting consideration of the water beneath the 10{\textdegree}C isotherm underestimates the volume flux by half and the potential temperature and salinity flux by in excess of one third and one half, respectively. Using a base of the 3.5{\textdegree}C isotherm and including the high-salinity intermediate water from the Indian Ocean is found to be more appropriate. With these conditions, six Agulhas rings per year entering the subtropical South Atlantic would equate to a volume flux of 9 Sv and an absolute potential temperature and salinity flux of 84 Sv{\textdegree}C and 322 Sv psu (1 Sv psu {$\approx$} 106 kg s-1). The significant flux of intermediate water from the Indian Ocean may be as important in the return path of the thermohaline circulation as the intermediate water that enters the South Atlantic through Drake Passage. Further, the water associated with Agulhas rings and cooler than 10{\textdegree}C potentially contributes a larger volume flux to the warm water return path than the corresponding surface and upper thermocline water.},

The census demonstrates how, through non-conservative interactions  among closely approaching vortices, the vortex population evolves towards fewer,  larger, sparser, and more weakly deformed vortices. After emergence from random  initial conditions and a further period of population adjustment, there is a period of  approximately self-similar temporal evolution in the vortex statistics. This behaviour  is consistent with a mean-vortex scaling theory based on the conservation of energy,  vortex extremum, and vortex aspect ratio. This period terminates as the population  approaches a late-time non-turbulent end-state vortex configuration. The end state  develops out of merger and alignment interactions among like-sign vortices, and even  during the scaling regime, local clusters of nearly aligned vortices are common.},

The multiyear altimetry data reveal that the eastward-flowing STCC is a highly variable zonal current, whose area-averaged eddy kinetic energy level (338 cm2 sϪ2) reaches half the eddy kinetic energy level of the Kuroshio Extension. The eddy kinetic energy of the STCC has a well-defined annual cycle with a maximum in April/May and a minimum in December/January. The peak-to-peak amplitude of this seasonal eddy kinetic energy modulation exceeds 200 cm2 sϪ2. No such distinct annual cycle of the eddy kinetic energy is found in any other zonal current of the North Pacific Ocean. Using a 2{$\frac{1}{2}$}-layer reduced-gravity model representing the vertically sheared STCC{\textendash}North Equatorial Current (NEC) system, it is shown that the seasonal modulation of the STCC's eddy field is a manifestation in the intensity of baroclinic instability. In spring the STCC{\textendash}NEC system has a large vertical velocity shear and a weak vertical stratification, subjecting it to strong baroclinic instability. In fall, reduction in the vertical velocity shear between the STCC and its underlying NEC, and intensification of the upper-layer stratification weakens the baroclinic instability. In comparison with the STCC of 19{\cyrchar\CYRNJE}{\textendash}25{\cyrchar\CYRNJE}N, the altimetry data reveal that the westward-flowing NEC existing between 10{\cyrchar\CYRNJE} and 15{\cyrchar\CYRNJE}N has a relatively low eddy kinetic energy level, despite being a stronger vertically sheared zonal current than the STCC. That the NEC is less eddy energetic is shown to be due to both its presence in a low-latitude band and its unidirectional flow. Both of these factors make it more difficult to reverse the potential vorticity gradient of the mean state (i.e., satisfying the necessary condition for the baroclinic instability) in the NEC than in the STCC{\textendash}NEC system.},

In order to clarify the dynamic processes essential for the observed intraseasonal signals, the authors adopted in this study a fine-resolution 1{$\frac{1}{2}$}-layer reduced-gravity model and carried out a series of model experiments by varying coastline geometry and surface wind forcing. From these carefully designed experiments, they show that the intense 50-day oscillations observed at the entrance of Celebes Sea are a result of Rossby wave resonance in which the frequency of cyclonic eddy shedding by the retroflecting Mindanao Current matches that of the gravest Rossby mode of the semi-enclosed Celebes Sea basin. These 50-day oscillations of the Celebes Sea have a large impact on the throughflow in the Makassar Strait and Banda Sea, but do not contribute significantly to the throughflow changes in the Lombok, Ombai, and Timor Straits.},

As a preliminary to a dynamical and modeling discussion, we provide a description of the changes in variability on the annual and interannual time scales as seen in the TOPEX/POSEIDON altimeter data and in current meter records with a focus on the North Atlantic and North Pacific Oceans. The patterns of change and corresponding ones in the wind stress are globally very variable and intricate, with few easy generalizations possible. Over most of the subtropical oceans and along major mean fronts, seasonal variations of the eddy energy are negligible. There are, however, regions that show a pronounced annual cycle in eddy energy, notably the northeastern Pacific, the northern and eastern North Atlantic, as well as the tropical oceans. In those locations a strong correlation of a time-varying altimetric eddy kinetic energy on annual and longer periods with wind stress forcing is found, and trends present in near-surface eddy kinetic energy can be related to drifts in meteorological wind stress fields (mean and storm tracks) over the four-year TOPEX/POSEIDON record. While the seasonal cycles in mooring data are found generally to agree with altimetry, the only statistically significant evidence for interannual trends in current meter data appears in the long duration eastern Atlantic site mooring near 33{\textdegree}N, 22{\textdegree}W.},

  abstract = {Abstract A mechanism by which long planetary waves in the ocean may propagate significantly faster than the classical long baroclinic Rossby waves is investigated. The mechanism depends on the poleward thickening of intermediate density layers and the concomitant thinning of near-surface and deep layers. These features of the mass distribution are associated with the well-known homogenization of potential vorticity in intermediate density layers and with significantly elevated meridional potential vorticity gradients near the surface and somewhat at depth. The mechanism is explored in a simple three-layer model, in which the middle layer has zero potential vorticity gradient and is sandwiched between a surface layer with large potential vorticity gradient and a bottom layer with modest potential vorticity gradient. The effective phase speed of the planetary waves is merely the sum of the phase speeds of virtual baroclinic Rossby waves propagating on the individual layer interfaces as though the other interface were not there and as though there were no mean vertical shear. The mechanism is also examined for a continuous model with zero potential vorticity gradient throughout the interior and large virtual potential vorticity gradients near the surface and bottom. Planetary waves in these models can propagate westward up to twice as fast as baroclinic Rossby waves would through an ocean with the same vertical stratification, but no mean vertical shear. This explanation of the Rossby wave speedup complements a recent detailed theoretical calculation of planetary-wave phase speeds based on geostrophic velocity profiles from archived hydrographic data.},

Many cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies were observed in the region. Spatial and temporal scales of the eddies were determined by lag-correlation analyses in space and time. The eddies are circular in shape with a diameter of 500 km and a temporal scale of 80 days. Typical maximum surface velocity and sea surface height anomaly associated with the eddies are 15{\textendash}20 cm s-1 and 15 cm, respectively. The frequency of occurrence, temporal and spatial scales, and intensity are all nearly the same for the cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies, which are considered to be successive wave-like disturbances rather than solitary eddies. Phase speed of westward propagation of the eddies is estimated as 6.8 cm s-1, which is faster than a theoretical estimate based on the baroclinic first-mode Rossby wave with or without a mean current. The spatial distribution of sea surface height variations suggests that these eddies may be generated in the Kuroshio Extension region and propagate westward in the Kuroshio recirculation region, though further studies are needed to clarify the generation processes.},

The rate of spinup and the scale of the bottom flow depend on ⌳ {$\epsilon$} F2U1/␤2, which measures the importance of interfacial stretching to the bottom slope, with small values of ⌳ corresponding to a slow spinup and stronger along-isobath anisotropy. The slope also affects the mean size of the surface vortices, through the dispersal of flow at depth and by altering vortex stability. This too can be characterized in terms of the parameter, ⌳.},

Variations of mixed layer depth with time and lateral advection lead to a subduction field that is substantially different from the vertical velocity field. Vertical velocities associated with the growing instabilities push tongues of a ventilation tracer, initially only present within the surface layer, down to depths of up to 100 m. After 24 days a quarter of this ventilation tracer has been deposited in the thermocline. Conversely, the vertical motions pull nutrients from the thermocline up into the mixed layer, giving enhanced surface values along the front.

In its contracted state, the Kuroshio Extension has a smaller eastward surface transport, a more southerly mean path, and is accompanied by a weaker southern recirculation gyre.

  abstract = {In the two decades following 1975, the Kuroshio path south of Japan was observed to oscillate interannually between a straight path state and a meandering state. This bimodal condition is in sharp contrast to the decade prior to 1975 when the Kuroshio remained consistently in the straight path state. In situ observations in the upstream East China Sea indicate no obvious correspondence between the magnitude (or the temporal change) of the inflow transport and the Kuroshio path, suggesting the Kuroshio's path alternations in the recent two decades may not be externally determined by the upstream inflow. Using a two-layer primitive-equation model of the North Pacific driven by observed climatological surface wind data, the authors propose that the Kuroshio path oscillation since 1975 can be explained by a self-sustained internal mechanism of the Kuroshio current system. The proposed self-sustained oscillation is maintained by the accumulation of the low potential vorticity (PV) water carried northward by the upstream Kuroshio. This accumulation of the low-PV anomalies strengthens the Kuroshio's southern recirculation gyre and presses the Kuroshio to flow along the coast. The strengthening of the southern recirculation gyre increases the velocity shear of the straight-pathed Kuroshio and leads eventually to the meander path development due to baroclinic/barotropic instability of the system. As the meander of the Kuroshio path grows, detachment of cyclonic eddies mixes coastal-origin, high-PV water offshoreward, weakening, as a result, the recirculation gyre. The above cycle will restart after the low-PV water is replenished from the south and the recirculation gyre spins up again. For the past two decades, this internal oscillation has been operative because the upstream inflow is relatively large due to the decadal increase in the wind-driven Sverdrup transport. In the decade before 1975 when the upstream inflow was small, the internal oscillation would cease because the dissipative forces are able to remove the southern-origin low-PV anomalies without resorting to instability and the meander development.},

Rings preferentially crossed the Walvis Ridge at its deepest parts. After having crossed this ridge they have lower translational speeds, and their decay rate decreases markedly. Half the decay of long-lived rings takes place in the first 5 months of their lifetimes. In addition to the strong decay of rings in the Cape Basin, about one third of the observed rings do not seem to leave this region at all but totally disintegrate here. The interaction of rings with bottom topography, in particular with the Vema Seamount, is shown frequently to cause splitting of rings. This will enhance mixing of the rings' Indian Ocean water into that of the southern Atlantic. This localized mixing may well provide a considerable source of warm and salty Indian Ocean water into the Atlantic overturning circulation.},

The primary advantage of altimetry is that the data remain available in the summer. One finding is that the ambiguity of whether or not a ring has separated is reduced, but not eliminated; the uncertainty with which separation ``events'' can be specified remains approximately 4 weeks, even with nearly continuous data. Primary peaks in the distribution of separation intervals are found at 6 and 11 months with a smaller peak at 9 months. If the spectrum is smoothed heavily enough, a peak in the distribution can be formed nearer 12 months, but this near-annual peak is a result more of the smoothing than of the data.},

  abstract = {Abstract The influences of topography on the propagation, spatial patterns, and amplitude variations of long baroclinic Rossby waves are investigated with a wind-forced, two-layer model above a midocean ridge. With steep topography the evolution equation for the baroclinic mode is shown to differ from that for a flat bottom in several ways: 1) The phase speed is systematically faster by the factor H/H2, where H is the total ocean depth and H2 is the lower layer thickness, though the propagation remains westward and nearly nondispersive; 2) an effectively dissipative transfer to the barotropic mode occurs whenever the baroclinic mode is locally parallel to f/H contours, where f is the Coriolis frequency; and 3) the wind-forced response is amplified in proportion to the topographic steepness, (f/H)(dH/dx)/(df/dy), for a longitudinally varying topography, which can be a large factor, but the amplification is only by the modest factor H/H2 for a latitudinally varying topography. Effects 2 and 3 are the result of energy exchanges to and from the barotropic mode, respectively. Effect 3 causes freely propagating, baroclinic Rossby waves to be generated west of the ridge. These effects collectively cause distortions of the baroclinic wave pattern as it traverses the ridge. These effects account qualitatively for several features seen in altimetric measurements in the vicinity of major topographic features: an increase in variance of baroclinic signals on the west side, an enhanced phase speed overall (compared to flat-bottom waves), and an abrupt change in the phase speed at midocean ridges.},

Every eddy had a cold, low salinity and low potential vorticity core, suggesting a strong influence from the Okhotsk Sea water. Two formation processes and annual variations were found with satellite data analyses. One is the case where eddies are locally formed south of the Bussol' Strait and intensified from summer to fall with the supply of Okhotsk Sea water as observed in 1993. In the other case, Kuroshio warm-core rings that had translated northeastward are arrested near the Bussol' Strait and amplified with the supply of Okhotsk Sea water as seen from summer to autumn in 1995. In winter, eddies tend to move northeastward with decay. The 1992 eddy moved northeastward then northward in winter and was eventually absorbed into the East Kamchatka Current. Mechanisms of the northeastward movements and the formations of the Bussol' eddies were discussed. A pseudo-{$<$}em{$>\beta<$}/em{$>$} effect due to deep northeastward currents along the Kuril{\textendash}Kamchatka Trench could be responsible for the northeastward movement. Since the volume transport of the coastal Oyashio water along the southern Kuril Islands is constrained by the potential vorticity difference between the Okhotsk Sea and the western subarctic gyre (WSAG), eddies could be generated and intensified when a outflow rate from the Okhotsk Sea exceeds the critical transport. The observed annual variations of the eddy evolution might be explained by the critical transport variation associated with an annual change of the WSAG.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

It is diagnostically related to velocity and pressure, when the vortex is stationary. Stationary vortices can be monopolar (circular or elliptical) or multipolar; their stability analysis shows thattransitions between the various stationary shapes are possible when they become unstable. But stable vortices can also undergo unsteady evolutions when perturbed by environmental effects, likelarge-scale shear or strain fields, {$\beta$}-effect or topography. Changes in vortex shapes can also result from vortex interactions. such as the pairing, merger or vertical alignment of two vortices, which depend on their relative polarities and depths. Such interactions transfer energy and enstrophy between scales, and are essential in two-dimensional and in geostrophic turbulence.

  abstract = {Abstract One of the most successful applications of satellite-borne radar altimeter data over the oceans in recent years has been the extraction of information about long-wavelength baroclinic Rossby (or planetary) waves, which play a significant role in ocean circulation and climate dynamics. These waves cross ocean basins from east to west at speeds of a few centimeters per second at midlatitudes. The cross-basin propagation time may therefore be several months or even years, and an accurate estimation of the speed of the waves is important. Methods are reviewed for obtaining information on Rossby wave velocity from altimetry data, particularly the two-dimensional Radon transform. Unfortunately, the use of longitude{\textendash}time plots, although it allows the estimation of the zonal phase speeds, does not give any information on the velocity vector when the propagation of the waves is not purely zonal (east{\textendash}west). As shown here, the two-dimensional Radon transform can be generalized to three dimensions, enabling not only the true propagation velocity component to be determined but also the direction of the waves and thus any deviation from the pure-westward case. As examples of the application of this extended technique, maps of direction, speed, and energy of Rossby waves in the North Atlantic Ocean are shown.},

Oceanic tropical instability waves (TIWs) with periods of 20{\textendash}40 days and wavelengths of 1000{\textendash}2000 km perturb the SST fronts that bracket both sides of the equatorial cold tongue, which is centered near 1{\cyrchar\CYRNJE}S to the east of 130{\cyrchar\CYRNJE}W.

The wind stress divergence is shown to be linearly related to the downwind component of the SST gradient with a response on the south side of the cold tongue that is about twice that on the north side. The wind stress curl is linearly related to the crosswind component of the SST gradient with a response that is approximately half that of the wind stress divergence response to the downwind SST gradient. The perturbed SST and wind stress fields propagate synchronously westward with the TIWs.

Cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies have been traced on maps of the filtered SSH anomaly fields composed from the altimeter observations every ten days. Both the cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies propagate westward in the Kuroshio recirculation region from a region south of the Kuroshio Extension. The propagation speed of these eddies has been estimated as about 7 cm s-1, which is much faster than the phase speed theoretically estimated for the baroclinic first-mode Rossby wave in the study area. It was also found that in the Izu-Ogasawara Ridge region, most of eddies pass through the gap between the Hachijojima Island and Ogasawara (Bonin) Islands, and some of the eddies decay around the Izu-Ogasawara Ridge. It seems that the trajectory of the eddies is crucially affected by the bottom topography. In the region south of Shikoku and east of Kyushu, some of the eddies coalesce with the Kuroshio. It is also suggested that this coalescence may trigger the path variation of the Kuroshio in the sea south of Japan.},

  abstract = {The measurement of the global sea surface height made by the TOPEX/Poseidon satellite has provided the first synoptic view of large-scale oceanic variability at intraseasonal scales from weeks to months. Areas of significant intraseasonal variability were found primarily in the Tropics and the high-latitude oceans, the Southern Ocean in particular. The focus of the paper is the finding of large-scale oscillations at a period of 25 days in the Argentine Basin of the South Atlantic Ocean. These oscillations exhibit a dipole pattern of counterclockwise rotational propagation centered at 45{\cyrchar\CYRNJE}S, 317{\cyrchar\CYRNJE}E over the Zapiola Rise. The scale of the dipole is about 1000 km. The peak-to-trough amplitude is on the order of 10 cm. The amplitude of these oscillations has large seasonalto-interannual variations. These oscillations are shown to be associated with a free barotropic mode of the basin as a solution to a linearized barotropic vorticity equation. Closed f/H contours provide a mechanism for the confinement of the waves to the topographic feature of the Zapiola Rise. Results from a numerical model simulation reproduced the patterns of the observed oscillations. The resultant mass transport variability is on the order of 50 Sv (Sv {$\epsilon$} 106 m3 sϪ1). Deep current meters in the Argentine Basin reveal signals consistent with the altimetry observations.},

Warm-core rings which initially have baroclinic velocity near a steep bottom slope gradually move northward, but those with barotropic velocity do not. Barotropic velocity on the slope immediately disperses as a topographic Rossby wave, while baroclinic velocity is retained. Since the northward movement is caused by an effect very much like the image effect which is originally the effect of a free-slip wall, the authors term this effect the equivalent image effect. The equivalent image effect increases as a slope becomes steeper and bottom friction becomes weaker, and vice versa. It seems that a steep slope acts like a wall, and the bottom friction of a steep slope corresponds to the lateral viscous effect of a wall. However, the effect of a slope on a warm-core ring is different from that of a wall in that ring-slope interactions take place at the lower part of the ring. Because the velocity of a warm-core ring is weak in deep layers, ring-slope interactions are moderate and the leakage of the interior fluid of a ring seen in ring-wall interactions is not apparent, while the viscous effect is weaker than that of a no-slip wall as well. These results are applied to the northward movement of Kuroshio warm-core rings and to warm eddies in the Gulf of Mexico.},

As a result, most of the detailed phenomena associated with the narrow western boundary currents were revealed. Water from the Oyashio is seen to overshoot the zero zonally integrated wind-stress-curl line by more than 5{\cyrchar\CYRNJE}, approaching as far south as 36{\cyrchar\CYRNJE}{\textendash}38{\cyrchar\CYRNJE}N at the western boundary. Water from the Kuroshio Extension, by contrast, tends to feed into the Oyashio Front in the interior ocean. This exchange of waters leads to a zero of zonally integrated (western boundary{\textendash}180{\cyrchar\CYRNJE}) meridional transport at about 44{\cyrchar\CYRNJE}N, reasonably coinciding with the zero of zonally integrated wind stress curl in the western North Pacific. A well-defined double-front structure is seen at depths of the thermocline, but it does not appear to have a strong signature in the surface dynamic topography. Though always accompanied by strong temperature and salinity gradients, water density changes little across the Oyashio Front near the surface. Both the Kuroshio Extension and Oyashio Front have a significant deep component, but below 1000 m the former seems to be dominated by eddy features associated with the Kuroshio Extension recirculation gyre.},

Based on anomalies in dynamic height, 410 eddies are identified in 30 transects from 1991 to 1999, including eddies seen in multiple transects over a year or longer. Their wavelength is typically 500 km, with peak-to-trough temperature difference of 2.2{\cyrchar\CYRNJE}C in the center of the thermocline. The features slant westward with decreasing depth, by 0.8{\cyrchar\CYRNJE} of longitude on average from 400 m up to the sea surface. This tilt produces a depth-varying velocity/temperature correlation and hence a vertical meridional overturning circulation. In the mean, 3.9 Sv (Sv {$\epsilon$} 106 m3 sϪ1) of thermocline waters are carried southward by the eddy field over the width of the basin, balanced mainly by northward flow in the surface layer. Corresponding northward heat transport is 0.086 Ϯ 0.012 pW. The eddy field has considerable variability on seasonal to interannual timescales. For the 8-yr period studied here, eddy variability was the dominant mechanism for interannual change in the equatorward transport of thermocline waters, suggesting a potentially important forcing mechanism in the coupled air{\textendash}sea climate system.},

  abstract = {An idealized problem of a western boundary current of Munk thickness LM flowing across a gap in a ridge is considered using a single-layer depth-averaged approach. When the gap (of width 2a) is narrow, a Յ 3.12LM, viscous forces alone restrict penetration of the current through the gap. However, the gap is ``leaky'' in the linear case and some very weak flow still passes through. For larger gap width, the boundary current may leap across the gap due to inertia, characterized by the Reynolds number, completely choking off water exchange between the two basins. For a Ն 4.55LM the flow may be in one of two regimes (penetrating or leaping) for the same parameters, depending on previous evolution. The penetrating branch solutions become unsteady with eddies forming west of the gap between the two counterflowing zonal jets. As the boundary current slowly accelerates, transition from the penetrating to leaping regime happens when the width of a zonal jet near the gap becomes comparable with a, implying the Reynolds number ReP ഡ (a/LM)3. On the other hand, as the boundary current slowly decelerates, the leaping regime persists while the meridional advection dominates the ␤ effect in a wiggle of the current core within the gap, implying that the leaping regime breaks at ReL ഡ a/LM. Thus hysteresis occurs over the range of Reynolds numbers ReL Ͻ Re Ͻ ReP. This behavior is analogous to the well-known teapot effect.},

  abstract = {Abstract In layered models of the ocean, the assumption of a deep resting layer is often made, motivated by the surface intensification of many phenomena. The propagation speed of first-mode, baroclinic Rossby waves in such models is always faster than in models with all the layers active. The assumption of a deep-resting layer is not crucial for the phase-speed enhancement since the same result holds if the bottom pressure fluctuations are uncorrelated from the overlying wave dynamics. In this paper the authors explore the relevance of this behavior to recent observational estimates of ``too-fast'' waves by Chelton and Schlax. The available evidence supporting this scenario is reviewed and a method that extends the idea to a continuously stratified fluid is developed. It is established that the resulting amplification factor is at leading order captured by the formula, where Cfast is the enhanced phase speed, Cstandard the standard phase speed, {$\Phi{'}$}1(z) is the standard first mode for the velocity and pressure, and H0 is the reference depth serving to define it. In the case WKB theory is applicable in the vertical direction, the above formula reduces to where Nb is the deep Brunt{\textendash}V{\"a}is{\"a}l{\"a} frequency and N its vertical average. The amplification factor is computed from a global hydrographic climatology. The comparison with observational estimates shows a reasonable degree of consistency, although with appreciable scatter. The theory appears to do as well as the previously published mean-flow theories of Killworth et al. and others. The link between the faster mode and the surface-intensified modes occurring over steep topography previously discussed in the literature is also established.},

  abstract = {Primary productivity in the oceans is limited by the lack of nutrients in surface waters. These nutrients are mostly supplied from nutrient-rich subsurface waters through upwelling and vertical mixing1, but in the ocean gyres these mechanisms do not fully account for the observed productivity2. Recently, the upward pumping of nutrients, through the action of eddies, has been shown to account for the remainder of the primary productivity; however, these were regional studies which focused on mesoscale (100-km-scale) eddies3,4,5,6. Here we analyse remotely sensed chlorophyll and sea-surface-height data collected over two years and show that 1,000-km-scale planetary waves, which propagate in a westward direction in the oceans, are associated with about 5 to 20\% of the observed variability in chlorophyll concentration (after low-frequency and large-scale variations are removed from the data). Enhanced primary production is the likely explanation for this observation, and if that is the case, propagating disturbances introduce nutrients to surface waters on a global scale{\textemdash}similar to the nutrient pumping that occurs within distinct eddies.},

  abstract = {Numerical solutions of the unstable, growing modes are found for the two-layer inviscid quasigeostrophic equations in a meridional channel. A steady mean flow in the N-S direction is imposed in the upper layer, and it is assumed that changes in planetary vorticity following this mean flow are balanced by the input of vorticity from an imposed wind stress curl. Thus in the two-layer system, the vertical shear, in thermal wind balance, is associated with an interface slope which provides a gradient of potential vorticity (PV) in the x-direction, of equal magnitude and opposite sign in the two layers. In the y-direction the PV gradient has the value of planetary beta, \#, in both layers. The unstable modes of this system exhibit a boundary-layer structure across the channel. They are intensified in the west. The growth rates of the unstable modes are of the same order as the zonal case, however the range of wavenumber and shear for which instability is possible is larger. Established cutoff criteria for the equal-layer zonal case are not applicable, and no analogous criteria has yet been found. Growing modes are found even for very weakly sheared flows, and this suggests that baroclinic instability may represent a more significant source of mid-ocean eddy energy than previously believed.},

Prior to mapping, the pressure records were leveled (referenced to the same absolute geopotential) using the current measurements under the assumption that their mean fields are geostrophic. The leveled pressures were subsequently used together with the current measurements in a multivariate, nondivergent OI mapping procedure. This procedure significantly reduced the mapping errors, because both pressure and its (geostrophic) gradient are specified as inputs. The mapped bottom pressure and current fields have typical mean-square errors of only 0.0005 db2 and 4 cm2 sϪ2, compared to typical signal variances of 0.0035 db2 and 80 cm2 sϪ2. The daily maps of abyssal pressure are used to identify the characteristic space{\textendash}time structures of dynamical processes. Examples are shown in which deep-level cyclones spin up jointly with steep stationary troughs in the Gulf Stream and deep anticyclones with steep propagating crests. Another sequence of maps illustrates the propagation of topographic Rossby waves and ring{\textendash}stream interactions.},

It is argued that weak interactions often scatter radially symmetric eddies into generalized hetons. The dipole moments so generated within the eddy result in eddy propagations at various angles to the current. Strong interactions can result in the complete separation of the upper- and lower-layer circulations. Subsequent evolution in this case depends on many factors, although strong topographic obstacles (i.e., seamounts) permit a reorganization of the centers into a coherent structure. Weaker topography, confined to the deep ocean, can disrupt the lower center, although the upper center typically survives. Disassociation of the centers with both retaining their integrity is also possible. Heton generation can occur for eddies with weak lower-layer expressions, demonstrating a potentially strong control of shallow eddy propagation by deep sea bathymetry. Analytical and numerical estimates of the induced propagation speeds are sizable, arguing topographic scattering is a potentially powerful mechanism influencing eddy propagation.},

  abstract = {Abstract Interannual variability in the eastern subtropical North Pacific Ocean is investigated using the Naval Research Laboratory Layered Ocean Model (NLOM). Emphasis is placed on examining the nature of westward propagating Rossby waves and their interaction with the overlying atmosphere. Singular value decomposition (SVD), complex empirical orthogonal function (CEOF), and multichannel singular spectrum (M-SSA) analyses are used to isolate the standing and propagating response due to modeled Rossby waves and observed wind stress curl (WSC) anomalies as well as their dominant frequencies of oscillation, respectively. In addition to a large-scale interdecadal fluctuation, two distinct forms of Rossby waves are found to exist, one wind forced and the other freely propagating. SVD and CEOF analyses of NLOM upper layer thickness anomalies suggest a leading order source of variability stemming from a large-scale interdecadal fluctuation. M-SSA analysis also depicts this low frequency mode, but to a lesser extent and at higher order. The modeled temporal coverage limits the extent to which this feature can be studied further. Of primary interest in the eastern subtropical North Pacific Ocean are large-scale interannual wind-forced Rossby wave variations. Independent M-SSA analysis of modeled ULT and observed WSC anomalies suggests a low frequency ({$\sim$}51 month period) atmospherically forced ocean response in which westward atmospheric propagation leads forced oceanic Rossby wave propagation by roughly 3 months. In addition to this low frequency forced oceanic wave response with a phase speed of cr {$\sim$} 12 cm s-1, a distinct freely propagating biennial oceanic Rossby wave is also found to exist, with a phase speed of cr {$\sim$} 8 cm s-1, emanating from El Ni{\~n}o{\textendash}Southern Oscillation related coastally trapped Kelvin waves.},

  abstract = {Abstract Observations suggest the hypothesis that deep eddy kinetic energy (EKE) in the Gulf of Mexico can be accounted for by topographic Rossby waves (TRWs). It is presumed that the TRWs are forced by Loop Current (LC) pulsation, Loop Current eddy (LCE) shedding, and perhaps also by LCE itself. Although the hypothesis is supported by model results, such as those presented in Oey, the existence of TRWs in the model and how they can be forced by larger-scale LC and LCEs with longer-period vacillations have not been clarified. In this paper, results from a 10-yr simulation of LC and LCEs, with double the resolution of that used by Oey, are analyzed to isolate the TRWs. It is shown that along an east-to-west band across the gulf, approximately over the 3000-m isobath, significant EKE that accounts for over one-half of the total spectrum is contained in the 20{\textendash}100-day periods. Bottom energy intensification exists in this east{\textendash}west band with vertical decay scales of about 600{\textendash}300 m decreasing westward. The decrease agrees with the TRW solution. The band is also located within the region where TRWs can be supported by the topographic slope and stratification used in the model and where wavenumber and frequency estimates are consistent with the TRW dispersion relation. The analysis indicates significant correlation between pairs of east{\textendash}west stations, over distances of approximately 400 km. Contours of lag times suggest offshore (i.e., downslope) phase propagation, and thus the east{\textendash}west band indicates nearly parabathic and upslope energy propagation. Ray tracing utilizing the TRW dispersion relation and with and without (for periods {$>$}43 days) ambient deep currents shows that TRW energy paths coincide with the above east{\textendash}west high-energy band. It also explains that the band is a result of TRW refraction by an escarpment (with increased topographic gradient) across the central gulf north of the 3000-m isobath, and also by deep current and its cyclonic shear, and that ray convergence results in localized EKE maxima near 91{\textdegree}W and 94{\textdegree}{\textendash}95{\textdegree}W. Escarpment and cyclonic current shear also shorten TRW wavelengths. Westward deep currents increase TRW group speeds, by about 2{\textendash}3 km day-1 according to the model, and this and ray confinement by current shear may impose sufficient constraints to aid in inferring deep flows. Model results and ray paths suggest that the deep EKE east of about the 91{\textdegree}W originates from under the LC while farther west the EKE also originates from southwestward propagating LCEs. The near-bottom current fluctuations at these source regions derive their energy from short-period ({$<$}100 days) and short-wavelength ({$<$}200 km) near-surface fluctuations that propagate around the LC during its northward extrusion phase and also around LCEs as they migrate southwestward in the model.},

The primary goal is an understanding of the effect of this interaction on the Hawaiian Lee Countercurrent (HLCC), an eastward current crossing the Pacific west of Hawaii in the latitude band 18{\cyrchar\CYRNJE}{\textendash}21{\cyrchar\CYRNJE}N. A two-and-one-half-layer model is used, with the model island located in midgyre and equatorward of the gyre center, simulating the Hawaiian Islands. The presence of the island creates two wakes. A transport wake directly west of the island is characterized by an alteration of the zonal transport caused by the diversion of the interior flow incident upon the east coast of the island into zonal jets extending westward from the northern and southern tips of the island. A potential vorticity (pv) wake embedded in the second-layer streamlines westward and equatorward of the island is characterized by an alteration of the ventilated pv signature and of the baroclinic nature of the flow. The effects of the two wakes combine for a significant impact on both the transport and the baroclinic structure of the modeled HLCC, indicating that effective modeling of the HLCC should include not only the forcing mechanism, but also the influence of the large-scale Sverdrup flow to the east as modified by the Hawaiian Islands. In particular, a zonal variation in baroclinic structure is predicted that is consistent with observations.},

To facilitate the understanding of the observed changes, a two-layer ocean model was adopted that includes first-mode baroclinic Rossby wave dynamics and barotropic Sverdrup dynamics. The NPC intensified steadily over the T/P period from 1992 to 1998. Much of this intensification is due to the persistent sea surface height (SSH) drop on the northern side of the NPC. A similar SSH trend is also found in the interior of the Alaska gyre. Both of these SSH changes are shown to be the result of surface wind stress curl forcing accumulated along the baroclinic Rossby wave characteristics initiated from the eastern boundary. In addition to the interior SSH signals, the intensity of the Alaska gyre is shown to depend also on the SSH anomalies along the Canada/Alaska coast, and these anomalies are shown to be jointly determined by the signals propagating from lower latitudes and those forced locally by the alongshore surface winds. The WSG changed interannually from a zonally elongated gyre in 1993{\textendash}95 to a zonally more contracted gyre in 1997{\textendash}99. This structural change is due to the interannual SSH anomalies within the WSG as a result of the baroclinic Rossby wave adjustment attenuated by eddy dissipation. Along the western boundary of the subpolar North Pacific, variability of the East Kamchatka Current (EKC) and Oyashio is in balance with that of the interior Sverdrup flow on the annual and year-to-year timescales. On the multiyear timescales, the EKC/Oyashio variability is shown to be determined by the baroclinic SSH signals.},

  abstract = {Abstract A systematic analysis of North Pacific decadal variability in a full-physics coupled ocean{\textendash}atmosphere model is executed. The model is an updated and improved version of the coupled model studied by Latif and Barnett. Evidence is sought for determining the details of the mechanism responsible for the enhanced variance of some variables at 20{\textendash}30-yr timescales. The possible mechanisms include a midlatitude gyre ocean{\textendash}atmosphere feedback loop, stochastic forcing, remote forcing, or sampling error. Decadal variability in the model is expressed most prominently in anomalies of upper-ocean streamfunction, sea surface temperature (SST), and latent surface heat flux in the Kuroshio{\textendash}Oyashio extension (KOE) region off Japan. The decadal signal off Japan is initiated by changes in strength and position of the Aleutian low. The atmospheric perturbations excite SST anomalies in the central and eastern North Pacific (with opposing signs and canonical structure). The atmospheric perturbations also change the Ekman pumping over the North Pacific, which excites equivalent barotropic Rossby waves that carry thermocline depth perturbations toward the west. This gyre adjustment results in a shift in the border between subtropical and subpolar gyres after about five years. This process consequently excites SST anomalies (bearing the same sign as the central North Pacific) in the KOE region. The SST anomalies are generated by subsurface temperature anomalies that are brought to the surface during winter by deep mixing and are damped by air{\textendash}sea winter heat exchange (primarily latent heat flux). This forcing of the atmosphere by the ocean in the KOE region is associated with changes of winter precipitation over the northwestern Pacific Ocean. The polarity of SST and Ekman pumping is such that warm central and cool eastern Pacific anomalies are associated with a deep thermocline, a poleward shift of the border between subtropical and subpolar gyres, and warm SST anomalies and an increase of rain in the KOE region. The preponderance of variance at decadal timescales in the KOE results from the integration of stochastic Ekman pumping along Rossby wave trajectories. The Ekman pumping is primarily due to atmospheric variability that expresses itself worldwide including in the tropical Pacific. A positive feedback between the coupled model KOE SST (driven by the ocean streamfunction) and North Pacific Ekman pumping is consistent with the enhanced variance of the coupled model at 20{\textendash}30-yr periods. However, the time series are too short to unambiguously distinguish this positive feedback hypothesis from sampling variability. No evidence is found for a midlatitude gyre ocean{\textendash}atmosphere delayed negative feedback loop. Comparisons with available observations confirm the seasonality of the forcing, the up to 5-yr time lag between like-signed central North Pacific and KOE SST anomalies, and the associated damping of SST in the KOE region by the latent heat flux. The coupled model results also suggest that observed SST anomalies in the KOE region may be predictable from the history of the wind-stress curl over the North Pacific.},

These changes allow the parameterization to produce both realistic gradients of momentum and scalars in the nocturnal boundary layer and enhanced mixing during stable conditions. The revised parameterization is expected to produce improved representations of lateral advection and sea-surface temperature in large-scale models.},

  abstract = {Combining in-situ Lagrangian intermediate depth velocity measurements from the KAPEX (Cape of Good Hope Experiments) float program with sea-surface height data, this study reviews the inter-ocean exchange mechanisms around southern Africa. In the southeastern Cape Basin, a highly energetic field of coexisting anticyclonic and cyclonic eddies is documented. Agulhas Rings of typically 200km diameter are observed to merge, split, deform, and to reconnect to the Agulhas Retroflection. Concomitant, slightly smaller cyclones are observed to drift across the northwestward migration path of the Agulhas Rings. These cyclones, with typical diameters of 120km, are formed within the Cape Basin along the African shelf, inshore of the Agulhas Current, and in the subantarctic region south of Africa. The data suggest the annual formation of 3{\textendash}6 long-lived Agulhas Rings that eventually cross 5{\textdegree}E longitude, while approximately twice the number of rings occur in the southeastern Cape Basin. Within this region, cyclones outnumber anticyclones by a factor of 3:2. Both cyclones and anticyclones extend through the upper thermocline into the intermediate depth layer. Mean drifts of anticyclones are 3.8{$\pm$}1.2cms-1 to the northwest, while cyclones follow a west{\textendash}southwestward route at 3.6{$\pm$}0.8cms-1. Transport estimates suggest that the intermediate depth layer in the southeastern Cape Basin is primarily supplied from the east (approximately 9Sv), with minor direct inflow from the Atlantic to the west and south. Cyclone/anticyclone interaction is surmised to result in vigorous stirring and mixing processes in the southeastern Cape Basin, which necessitates a review of the traditional concept of Indo-Atlantic inter-ocean exchange. We propose to limit the concept of ``isolated Agulhas Rings embedded in a sluggish Benguela Drift'' to the northwestern Cape Basin and beyond, while linking this regime to the Agulhas Retroflection proper through a zone of turbulent stirring and mixing in the southeastern Cape Basin, named for the first time the ``Cape Cauldron'' hereinafter.},

The latitudinal structures of SSH and both components of geostrophic velocity are found to be asymmetric about the equator across the entire Pacific with larger amplitude north of the equator. The westward phase speeds are estimated by several different methods to be in the range 0.5-0.6 m s     \textsuperscript{-}     \textsuperscript{1}     . These observed characteristics are inconsistent with the classical theory for first vertical, first meridional mode equatorially trapped Rossby waves, which predicts a phase speed of about 0.9 m s     \textsuperscript{-}     \textsuperscript{1}     with latitudinally symmetric structures of SSH and zonal velocity and antisymmetric structure of meridional velocity. The observations are even less consistent with the latitudinal structures of SSH and geostrophic velocity components for other modes of the classical theory.The latitudinal asymmetries deduced here have also been consistently observed in past analyses of subsurface thermal data and altimeter data and have been variously attributed to sampling errors in the observational data, a superposition of multiple meridional Rossby wave modes, asymmetric forcing by the wind, and forcing by cross-equatorial southerly winds in the eastern Pacific. We propose a different mechanism to account for the observed asymmetric latitudinal structure of low-frequency equatorial Rossby waves. From the free-wave solutions of a simple 1.5-layer model, it is shown that meridional shears in the mean equatorial current system significantly alter the potential vorticity gradient in the central and eastern tropical Pacific. The observed asymmetric structures of sea surface height and geostrophic velocity components are found to be a natural consequence of the shear modification of the potential vorticity gradient. The mean currents also reduce the predicted westward phase speed of first meridional mode Rossby waves, improving consistency with the observations.},

This is shown to be a wave interference problem similar to the classical optics problem of multiple beam interference. The outlet of an ideal strait has the same reflection characteristics as the inlet, setting up internal reflections within the strait and a consequent interference condition that has several important consequences: energy transmission of a strait is a function of channel length as well as width; transmission is frequency dependent, and approaches 100\% at low frequencies for all channel widths, as long as the dynamics remain linear and inviscid; and the amplitude of the pressure signal on the downstream side of the channel approaches zero as the transmission approaches 100\%. Numerical solutions are found for transmission through a strait with coastal geometry corresponding to the 200-m isobath at Lombok Strait, and the results show that the ideal strait model with an appropriate effective width can accurately predict the transmission characteristics of a more complex strait. In particular, even though the minimum channel width is less than one-fifth of the local Rossby radius, the strait is shown to approach total transmission within the intraseasonal frequency band.},

At densities greater than 26.9 {$\sigma\theta$} the northwest polynya is the only contributor to OSMW. (Although Shelikhov Bay polynyas produce the densest water with {$\sigma\theta$} {$>$} 27.1, vigorous tidal mixing leads to outflow of water with a density of only about 26.7 {$\sigma\theta$}). In the western Okhotsk Sea the East Sakhalin Current rapidly transports modified dense shelf water along the eastern Sakhalin slope to the Kuril Basin, where it is subject to further mixing because of the large anticyclonic eddies and tides. Most of the dense water flows off the shelves in spring. Their average flux does not exceed 0.2 Sv in summer and fall. The shelf water transport and water exchange with the North Pacific cause large seasonal variations of temperature at densities of 26.7{\textendash}27.0 {$\sigma\theta$} (depths of 150{\textendash}500 m) in the Kuril Basin, where the average temperature minimum occurs in April{\textendash}May, and the average temperature maximum occurs in September, with a range of 0.2{\textdegree}{\textendash}0.7{\textdegree}C. The average seasonal variations of salinity are quite small and do not exceed 0.05 psu. The Soya Water mixed by winter convection, penetrating to depths greater than 200 m, in the southern Kuril Basin also produces freezing water with density greater than 26.7 {$\sigma\theta$}. Using a simple isopycnal box model and seasonal observations, the OSMW production rate is seen to increase in summer up to 2.2 {$\pm$} 1.7 Sv, mainly because of increased North Pacific inflow, and drops in winter to 0.2 {$\pm$} 0.1 Sv. A compensating decrease in temperature in the Kuril Basin implies a DSW volume transport of 1.4 {$\pm$} 1.1 Sv from February through May.

The method is based on finding the sign of Q, which is an invariant of the velocity gradient tensor ({$\nabla$}u). This parameter, commonly used in studies of two-dimensional turbulence, measures the relative contribution of deformation and vorticity. Vortex cores are associated with regions with large and positive values of Q. It is shown that this parameter is adequate to detect marine eddies in altimetric maps and, when the geometry of streamline contours in SLA maps is unclear, the Q {$>$} 0 criterion appears to work more consistently. The performance of the methodology is applied, as an example, to altimetric maps of the Algerian Basin in the Western Mediterranean Sea, where two long-lived eddies are tracked. The observed trajectories are in good agreement with Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) images.},

Lagged correlation maps of the altimeter-derived sea level anomalies (SLAs) along the trench indicate that the southern eddies on the whole move northeastward along the K-K Trench and the northern eddies, on the other hand, move southwestward. By tracking each anticyclonic eddy, its propagating velocity along the trench is calculated. The time series of the tracked 7 eddies shows similar seasonal variation to those of the first empirical orthogonal function (EOF) of the SLA maps and to those of the Sverdrup transport at 40{\textdegree}N. In addition, when more than two eddies remotely exist in the studied area, they show coherent moving patterns. These results suggest that the eddies in the western boundary region of the subarctic North Pacific are advected by the time-dependent wind-driven current.},

Concurrent gyre spin-up also affects major currents and slowing of oceanic migration has probably enhanced starvation and predation losses. Local factors, such as unfavourable wind-driven currents, can also affect recruitment of glass eels on continental shelves. In contrast, evidence is discussed that indicates fishing mortality and continental climate change appear to have had lesser impacts. Similar starvation{\textendash}advection explanations for declines in Japanese eel recruitment are proposed.

  abstract = {This paper is an observational study of small-scale coherent eddies in the Labrador Sea, a region of dense water formation thought to be of considerable importance to the North Atlantic overturning circulation. Numerical studies of deep convection emphasize coherent eddies as a mechanism for the lateral transport of heat, yet their small size has hindered observational progress. A large part of this paper is therefore devoted to developing new methods for identifying and describing coherent eddies in two observational platforms, current meter moorings and satellite altimetry. Details of the current and water mass structure of individual eddy events, as they are swept past by an advecting flow, can then be extracted from the mooring data. A transition is seen during mid-1997, with long-lived boundary current eddies dominating the central Labrador Sea year-round after this time, and convectively formed eddies similar to those seen in deep convection modeling studies apparent prior to this time. The TOPEX / Poseidon altimeter covers the Labrador Sea with a loose ``net'' of observations, through which coherent eddies can seem to appear and disappear. By concentrating on locating and describing anomalous events in individual altimeter tracks, a portrait of the spatial and temporal variability of the underlying eddy field can be constructed. The altimeter results reveal an annual ``pulsation'' of energy and of coherent eddies originating during the late fall at a particular location in the boundary current, pinpointing the time and place of the boundary current-type eddy formation. The interannual variability seen at the mooring is reproduced, but the mooring site is found to be within a localized region of greatly enhanced eddy activity. Notably lacking in both the annual cycle and interannual variability is a clear relationship between the eddies or eddy energy and the intensity of wintertime cooling. These eddy observations, as well as hydrographic evidence, suggest an active role for boundary current dynamics in shaping the energetics and water mass properties of the interior region.},

  abstract = {This paper addresses the structure and dynamical mechanisms of regional and mesoscale physical variability in the subtropical northeast Pacific Ocean using the Regional Oceanic Modeling System (ROMS). The model is configured with a U.S. West Coast domain that spans the California Current System (CCS) with a mesoscale horizontal resolution up to as fine as 3.5 km. Its mean-seasonal forcing is by momentum, heat, and water fluxes at the surface and adaptive nudging to gyre-scale fields at the open water boundaries. Its equilibrium solutions show realistic mean and seasonal states and vigorous mesoscale eddies, fronts, and filaments. The level of eddy kinetic energy (EKE) in the model is comparable to drifter and altimeter estimates in the solutions with sufficiently fine resolution. Because the model lacks nonseasonal transient forcing, the authors conclude that the dominant mesoscale variability in the CCS is intrinsic rather than transiently forced. The primary eddy generation mechanism is the baroclinic instability of upwelling, alongshore currents. There is progressive movement of meanseasonal currents and eddy energy offshore and downward into the oceanic interior in an annually recurrent cycle. The associated offshore eddy heat fluxes provide the principal balance against nearshore cooling by mean Ekman transport and upwelling. The currents are highly nonuniform along the coast, with important influences by capes and ridges in both maintaining mean standing eddies and launching transient filaments and fronts.},

This positive SST{\textendash}wind correlation in KE is confirmed by in situ buoy measurements and is consistent with a vertical shear adjustment mechanism. Namely, an increase in SST reduces the static stability of the near-surface atmosphere, intensifying the vertical turbulence mixing and bringing fastmoving air from aloft to the sea surface.},

  abstract = {The surface wind stress response to sea surface temperature (SST) over the latitude range 30{\cyrchar\CYRNJE}{\textendash}60{\cyrchar\CYRNJE}S in the Southern Ocean is described from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's QuikSCAT scatterometer observations of wind stress and Reynolds analyses of SST during the 2-yr period August 1999 to July 2001. While ocean{\textendash}atmosphere coupling at midlatitudes has previously been documented from several case studies, this is the first study to quantify this relation over the entire Southern Ocean. The spatial structures of the surface wind perturbations with wavelengths shorter than 10{\cyrchar\CYRNJE} latitude by 30{\cyrchar\CYRNJE} longitude are closely related to persistent spatial variations of the SST field on the same scales. The wind stress curl and divergence are shown to be linearly related, respectively, to the crosswind and downwind components of the SST gradient. The curl response has a magnitude only about half that of the divergence response. This observed coupling is consistent with the hypothesis that SST modification of marine atmospheric boundary layer (MABL) stability affects vertical turbulent mixing of momentum, inducing perturbations in the surface winds. The nonequivalence between the responses of the curl and divergence to the crosswind and downwind SST gradients suggests that secondary circulations in the MABL may also play an important role by producing significant perturbations in the surface wind field near SST fronts that are distinct from the vertical turbulent transfer of momentum. The importance of the wind stress curl in driving Ekman vertical velocity in the open ocean implies that the coupling between winds and SST may have important feedback effects on upper ocean processes near SST fronts.},

  abstract = {A forcing mechanism is sought for the large-scale circulation changes in the Kuroshio Extension region of the western North Pacific Ocean as inferred by TOPEX/Poseidon sea surface height (SSH) data. The lowfrequency signal of the Kuroshio Extension over the last decade was characterized by a modulation in its zonal mean flow intensity: the mean Kuroshio Extension jet weakened progressively from 1993 to 1996 and this trend reversed after 1997. The ability to simulate the major trends in the observed SSH signals with linear vorticity dynamics leads the authors to conclude that the modulation in the zonal mean jet was remotely forced by wind stress curl anomalies in the eastern North Pacific Ocean related to the Pacific decadal oscillations (PDOs). To be specific, the weakening (strengthening) trend in 1993{\textendash}96 (1997{\textendash}2001) was caused by westward expansions of negative (positive) SSH anomalies south of the Kuroshio Extension and positive (negative) SSH anomalies north of the Kuroshio Extension. Emergence of oppositely signed SSH anomalies on the two sides of the Kuroshio Extension jet is due to the different propagating speeds of the baroclinic Rossby waves, which carry the windinduced SSH anomalies generated in the eastern North Pacific at different phases of the PDOs. Hindcasting the Kuroshio Extension jet strength over the last 45 years reveals that the jet modulation has a dominant timescale of ϳ12 yr. Given the location of the Kuroshio Extension jet relative to the maximum atmospheric forcing, it is found that this dominant timescale is consistent with the preferred timescale under a stochastic white-noise atmospheric forcing. It is hypothesized that this connection between the Kuroshio Extension strength and the latitudinally dependent baroclinic adjustment contributes to an increase in variance and persistence of the North Pacific midlatitude coupled system on the decadal timescale.},

The eddies' migration and their lifecycle are described. The formation of the eddies appears to be related to the dynamics of the Loop Current because the timing of their generation corresponds to the last stage of the anticyclone shedding from the Loop Current. The cyclones intensify while moving slightly to the northwest along the shelf break of the Campeche Bank; later, some cyclones are observed to move northward toward the Mississippi shelf break. The cyclones remain next to the Campeche Bank, south of 26{\cyrchar\CYRNJE}N, from 1.3 to 9.6 months; later, some of them move northward and strengthen by merging with other eddies, extending their life span. The eddies' vertical structure is analyzed with hydrographic data, and the connection between the formation of the cyclones and the evolution of the Loop Current is further described using sea surface temperature images.},

  abstract = {This paper examines the plausibility of mesoscale eddy generation through local baroclinic instability of weak midocean gyre flows. The main tool is a statistically steady, two-layer quasigeostrophic turbulence model driven by an imposed, horizontally homogeneous, vertically sheared mean flow and dissipated by bottom Ekman friction. A wide range of friction strengths is investigated. In the weakly damped limit, flow is nearly barotropic, and the horizontal length scale of barotropic energy increases with decreasing friction, consistent with previous studies. The strongly damped limit, explored here for the first time, is equivalent barotropic (lower-layer velocities are nearly zero) and features an increase in the horizontal scale of potential energy with increasing friction. Current-meter data suggest that midocean eddies lie between the barotropic and equivalent barotropic limits. In accord with this suggestion, the moderately damped regime of the model compares well to observations of eddy amplitude, vertical structure, and horizontal scale, especially when stratification is surface intensified. A review of pertinent observations suggests that mesoscale eddies may indeed lie in the moderately damped limit. These arguments are first developed in f -plane simulations. Previous studies of beta-plane turbulence have had eastward mean flows, and in this case eddy energy has little sensitivity to friction. However, midocean gyre flows are generally nonzonal, and this nonzonality appears to be a significant factor in the production of energetic eddies. Beta-plane turbulence driven by nonzonal mean flows is sensitive to bottom friction, such that moderate damping is required for model eddies to compare well to observations, as on the f plane. A heuristic argument is presented in support of this similarity.},

This description spans 8 years of data from 1993 to 2000. At first, we focus on the analysis of the mean eddy kinetic energy (EKE) and show that the major characteristics of mesoscale variability are realistically simulated despite an overestimation of the EKE model in the Gulf Stream region. We then describe the SLA space and timescales and propagation velocities at a resolution never achieved before. There is a high level of agreement between the model and altimeter values regarding spatial scales and propagation velocities. POP timescales are, however, significantly longer in the subtropical regions. The westward zonal propagation velocity of both the model and the observations are higher than the speed computed from standard Rossby wave theory. The effect of mean current advection on POP and TPERS propagation velocities is also clearly seen in the Labrador Current and in the Gulf Stream and its recirculations. Finally, a study of the seasonal and interannual variability of the high-frequency (HF) EKE is carried out. The model reproduces accurately most of the HF-EKE seasonal variations in the Caribbean Sea and at high latitudes despite a phase advance. A clear HF-EKE interannual variability is then evidenced. Our hypothesis is that a contraction of the subpolar and subtropical gyres due to the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) could explain a reduction of the eddy activity in the North Atlantic Current, in the Newfoundland basin, and in the Azores Current. In the Caribbean Sea, the interannual variability of the EKE for both POP and TPERS seems to be caused by an interannual variability of the wind stress.},

The model successfully reproduces the mesothermal structure consisting of a shallow temperature minimum and an underlying temperature maximum that are called the dichothermal and mesothermal waters, respectively. The mesothermal water is formed through cross-gyre exchange between the subtropical and subarctic gyres, whereas the dichothermal water originates from cold and low-salinity waters formed in the winter mixed layer. The horizontal distribution of the passive tracer injected into the subsurface layers south of Japan shows that warm and saline water of the Kuroshio in the density range of 26.8{\textendash}27.0 ␴␪ is the source of the mesothermal water. There are three pathways through which the Kuroshio waters enter the subarctic region. First, the Kuroshio waters that cross the gyre boundary in the western boundary region are carried to the Alaskan gyre by the northern part of the North Pacific Current. Second, the Kuroshio waters carried by the southern part of the North Pacific Current enter the Alaskan gyre through a cross-gyre window in the eastern basin. Third, the Kuroshio waters that diffuse along the isopycnal in the Kuroshio{\textendash}Oyashio Extension enter the western subarctic gyre. The mesothermal water thus formed in the subarctic region is entrained into the winter mixed layer and returns to the subtropics as surface water by the southward Ekman drift, forming the subpolar cell.},

  abstract = {Over the past century, tide gauges in Hawaii have recorded interdecadal sea level variations that are coherent along the island chain. The generation of this signal and its relationship to other interdecadal variability are investigated, with a focus on the last decade. Hawaii sea level is correlated with sea surface height (SSH) over a significant portion of the North Pacific Ocean, and with the Pacific{\textendash}North America (PNA) index, which represents teleconnections between tropical and midlatitude atmospheric variations. Similar variations extend well below the thermocline in World Ocean Atlas temperature. Comparison with NCEP reanalysis wind and pressure shows that high (low) sea level phases around Hawaii are associated with an increase (decrease) in the strength of the Aleutian low. The associated wind stress curl pattern is dynamically consistent with observed sea level anomalies, suggesting that sea level at Hawaii represents large-scale changes that are directly windforced in concert with the PNA. Atmospheric modulation, as opposed to Rossby wave propagation, may explain the linkage of Hawaii sea level to North American sea level and ENSO events. A wind-forced, baroclinic Rossby wave model replicates some aspects of the interdecadal SSH variations and their spatial structure but fails to predict them in detail near Hawaii. The accuracy of wind products in this region and over this time period may be a limiting factor. Variations in mixed layer temperature due to surface heat flux anomalies may also contribute to the interdecadal sea level signal at Hawaii.},

  abstract = {Three Algerian eddies (open sea big anticyclonic eddies in the Algerian basin, western Mediterranean sea) are studied in detail using altimetric and in situ data. To characterize their spatial structure we make use of the Okubo{\textendash}Weiss parameter, which allows to separate the flow into vorticity-dominated and deformation-dominated regions. The application of this parameter to geostrophic velocity fields obtained from Sea Level Anomaly maps show that the observed eddies have a spatial structure in close resemblance to that found in coherent vortices of two-dimensional turbulence. These eddies appear to have a rather coherent vorticity-dominated core region surrounded by an outer region dominated by deformation with a very complicated and variable in time structure. This analysis is also applied to CTD data collected across three eddies sampled between 1997 and 1998. From these data eddy cores are equivalently defined as the interior region enclosed by the maximum of azimuthal velocity, and are consistent with the horizontal structures seen in SLA maps. The distinction between the core and the outer region (circulation cell) is particularly important to understand the role of transport and stirring of properties associated to eddies, as illustrated by the observed salinity structure, some selected SST images, and drifter trajectories. The core is characterized by very small isopycnal salinity gradients, while the surrounding cell is characterized by a strong slope of isohalines with respect to isopycnals. Persistent stagnation points are observed around the eddy and correspond to regions of high values of deformation with respect to vorticity. These regions allow analyzing characteristic patterns seen in the corresponding SST images. In addition, drifters trajectories exhibit very different behavior when crossing such regions.},

Such modes are also consistent with evidence of the westward phase propagation in satellite altimetry data. In both the theory and the observations, the scale of the waves is large in comparison with the Rossby radius of deformation and the orientation of fluid motion in the waves is predominantly meridional. These two facts suggest that the waves are vulnerable to baroclinic instability on the scale of the deformation radius. The key dynamical parameter is the ratio Z of the transit time of the long Rossby wave to the e-folding time of the instability. When this parameter is small the wave easily crosses the basin largely undisturbed by the instability; if Z is large the wave succumbs to the instability and is largely destroyed before making a complete transit of the basin. For small Z, the instability is shown to be a triad instability; for large Z the instability is fundamentally similar to the Eady instability mechanism. For all Z, the growth rate is on the order of the vertical shear of the basic wave divided by the deformation radius. If the parametric dependence of Z on latitude is examined, the condition of unit Z separates latitudes south of which the Rossby wave may successfully cross the basin while north of which the wave will break down into smallscale eddies with a barotropic component. The boundary between the two corresponds to the domain boundary found in satellite measurements. Furthermore, the resulting barotropic wave field is shown to propagate at speeds about 2 times as large as the baroclinic speed, and this is offered as a consistent explanation of the observed discrepancy between the satellite observations of Chelton and Schlax and simple linear wave theory. Here it is suggested that Rossby basin modes, if they exist, would be limited to tropical domains and that a considerable part of the observed midlatitude eddy field north of that boundary is due to the instability of wind-forced, long Rossby waves.},

  abstract = {The structure of the potential vorticity flux and a mean flow induced by a topographic wave incident over a bottom slope are investigated analytically and numerically, with focus on the case that bottom friction is the dominant dissipation process. In this case it is shown that the topographic wave cannot be a steady source of the potential vorticity outside the bottom Ekman layer. Instead, the distribution of potential vorticity is determined from the initial transient of the topographic wave. This potential vorticity and the heat flux by the topographic wave at the bottom determine the mean flow and give a relation between the horizontal and vertical scales of the mean flow. When the horizontal scale of the mean flow is larger than the internal deformation radius and the potential vorticity is not so large, the mean flow is almost constant with depth independent of whether the topographic wave is bottom intensified. Then the mean flow is proportional to the divergence of the vertically integrated Reynolds stress. This divergence, which is caused by bottom friction, is large when the group velocity cg and the vertical scale ␮Ϫ1 of the wave motion are small. Thus, the mean flow tends to be large where cg and ␮Ϫ1 become small and decreases as the topographic wave is dissipated by bottom friction. Because bottom friction also dissipates the mean flow, the mean flow asymptotically approaches a constant value as the friction becomes zero. These features of the potential vorticity flux and the mean flow are reproduced in numerical experiments in which it is also shown that the distribution of the mean flow depends on the amplitude of the wave because of the Doppler shift of the wave by the mean flow. These features of the mean flow are preserved when stratification and bottom topography resembling those over the continental slope near the Gulf Stream are used. The transport of the mean flow is about 20 Sv (Sv {$\epsilon$} 106 m3 sϪ1) when the wave amplitude is about 2 cm sϪ1. This transport is similar to that of the recirculation gyre in the Gulf Stream region.},

  abstract = {Abstract This study uses satellite observations of sea surface height (SSH) to detect westward-propagating anomalies, presumably baroclinic Rossby waves, in the North Atlantic and to estimate their period, wavelength, amplitude, and phase speed. Detection involved a nonlinear fit of the theoretical dispersion relation for Rossby waves to the time{\textendash}longitude spectrum at a given latitude. Estimates of period, wavelength, and phase speed resulted directly from the detection process. Based on these, a filter was designed and applied to extract the Rossby wave signal from the data. This allowed a mapping of the spatial variability of the Rossby wave amplitude for the North Atlantic. Results showed the familiar larger speed of observed Rossby waves relative to that expected from theory, with the largest differences occurring at shorter periods. The data also show that the dominant Rossby waves, those with periods that are less than annual, propagated with almost uniform speed in the western part of the North Atlantic between 30{\textdegree} and 40{\textdegree}N. In agreement with previous studies, the amplitude of the Rossby wave field was higher in the western part of the North Atlantic than in the eastern part. This is often attributed to the influence of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. By contrast, this study, through an analysis of the wave spatial structure, suggests that the source of the baroclinic Rossby waves at midlatitudes in the western North Atlantic is located southeast of the Grand Banks where the Gulf Stream and the deep western boundary current interact with the Newfoundland Ridge. The spatial structure of the waves in the eastern North Atlantic is consistent with the formation of these waves along the basin's eastern boundary.},

High{\textendash}eddy kinetic energy (EKE) bands with well-defined annual cycles are detected along the eastward-flowing surface currents of the South Tropical Countercurrent (STCC) between 21{\cyrchar\CYRNJE}{\textendash}29{\cyrchar\CYRNJE}S and the South Equatorial Countercurrent (SECC) centered near 9{\cyrchar\CYRNJE}S. Overriding the westward-flowing South Equatorial Current (SEC), the STCC layer has the sign of its mean potential vorticity gradient opposite to that in the SEC layer, subjecting the vertically sheared STCC{\textendash}SEC system to baroclinic instability. In austral winter, the STCC{\textendash}SEC system is baroclinically more unstable than in other seasons because of the large vertical shear and weak stratification. This seasonal variation in the intensity of baroclinic instability is responsible for the seasonal modulation of the STCC's EKE field with a November{\textendash}December maximum and a June{\textendash}July minimum. The large deformation radius in the low-latitude SECC region, on the other hand, prevents the vertically sheared SECC{\textendash}SEC system from becoming baroclinically unstable. With the broad, westward-flowing SEC weakening the stabilizing planetary ␤ effect, the high EKE level observed along the SECC is found to result from the barotropic instability associated with the horizontal shear of the SECC{\textendash}SEC system. Together with an analysis of energetics, it is shown that the seasonal variation in the intensity of barotropic instability accounts for the seasonal modulation of the SECC's EKE field, with a maximum in April and a minimum in August.},

Besides the welldefined annual cycles, the observed heat and momentum fluxes are dominated by signals related to synopticscale weather disturbances. The synoptic-scale heat flux signals have a dominant time scale of 3{\textendash}14 days, whereas the wind stress signals have a scale of 2{\textendash}8 days. A comparison between the heat fluxes estimated using the buoy measurements and those from the NCEP reanalysis reveals that the daily NCEP product overestimates both the incoming solar radiation at sea surface and the turbulent heat flux amplitude associated with the individual weather events. The rms amplitude of the synoptic-scale net heat flux of the NCEP product is found to be positively biased by 23\%. Despite this amplitude bias, the NCEP product captures the timing and relative strength of the synoptic-scale net heat flux forcing very well. A favorable comparison is also found between the daily surface wind stress forcing from the buoy and that from the NCEP product on the synoptic time scales. Using a bulk surface mixed layer model, we find that the synoptic-scale forcing can significantly change the SSTs in spring{\textendash}summer seasons. The synoptic-scale heat flux{\textendash}induced SST anomalies have a typical amplitude of Ϯ1{\cyrchar\CYRNJE}C, whereas the wind-induced SST anomalies depend on the accumulation of large-amplitude wind events. Excessive accumulation, which occurred, for example, in 1997, can result in unseasonally cold summertime SST anomalies. From both the observations and the model, the frequency spectra for the synoptic-scale SST signals show a clear ␻Ϫ2 dependency. While this dependency is consistent with the ``white'' surface heat flux forcing in the frequency band of 1/100{\textendash}1/16 days, short-term mixed layer depth changes induced by the synoptic-scale atmospheric forcing are argued to be important in determining the SST spectral shape in the higher-frequency band.},

Cool ocean{\textendash}atmosphere interaction is poorly understood and this lack of understanding is a stumbling block in the current effort to study non-ENSO climate variability. Using new satellite observations, the response of surface wind and low clouds to changes in SST is investigated over cool oceans, where the planetary boundary layer (PBL) is often capped by a temperature inversion. While one-way atmospheric forcing is a major mechanism for basinscale SST variability in the extratropics, clear wind response is detected in regions of strong ocean currents. In particular, SST modulation of vertical momentum mixing emerges as the dominant mechanism for SST-induced wind variability near oceanic fronts around the world, which is characterized by a positive SST{\textendash}wind speed correlation. Several types of boundary layer cloud response are found, whose correlation with SST varies from positive to negative, depending on the role of surface moisture convergence. Noting that the surface moisture convergence is strongly scale dependent, it is proposed that horizontal scale is important for setting the sign of this SST{\textendash}cloud correlation. Finally, the processes by which a shallow PBL response might lead to a deep, tropospheric-scale response and the implications for the study of extratropical basin-scale air{\textendash}sea interaction are discussed.},

Long-lived anticyclonic eddies propagate northwestward with a mean angle of around 333{\textdegree}T, whereas cyclonic vortices propagate westward, consistent with the vortices propagation theory on a {$\beta$} plane. The radial distribution of the swirl velocity shows that the Chile-Peru Current eddies have a maximum diameter of order 200 km with a swirl velocity of around 14 cm s-1 and a rotation period of 50 days. Hydrographic data reveal a vertical extent down to around 2000 m for energetic eddies. No significant difference is observed between the tangential velocities of cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies.

  abstract = {Abstract The classical problem of a point source situated along a southern boundary emptying buoyant water into a ({$\beta$} plane) ocean is revisited. Pichevin and Nof (PN) have shown that, in contrast to the view prevailing at the time, such an inviscid outflow does not simply turn to the right. Rather, it bifurcates into two branches: a steady branch that does turn to the right (eastward) and an unsteady branch that periodically sheds eddies to the left (westward). This partition is because a simple turn to the right of the entire outflow leaves the outflow's long-shore momentum flux unbalanced, creating a paradox. In contrast, the branching allows the westward-drifting eddies (westward branch) to balance the momentum flux of the steady current (eastward branch). Although the analytical PN solution is useful and informative, it is cumbersome and difficult to apply to actual outflows. Here, a considerably simpler nonlinear analytical solution is presented. Using the idea that the eddies grow slowly relative to their rotation rate, it is shown that an intense (i.e., large Rossby number) and large relative vorticity outflow dumps most of its mass flux (Q) into the eddies (66\%). (The remaining 33\% goes into the eastward long-shore current.) By contrast, a weak outflow (i.e., an outflow with weak anticyclonic vorticity -{$\alpha$}f, where {$\alpha$} is analogous to the Rossby number and is much smaller than unity and f is the Coriolis parameter) dumps most of its water into the downstream current [(1{\textendash}2{$\alpha$})Q]. Unexpectedly, this partition of mass turns out to be the same as the one taking place on an f plane. (Note that this is not at all the case for southward outflow nor is it the case for either eastward or westward outflow, where {$\beta$} alters the balance drastically.) Although the above partition of mass is independent of {$\beta$}, the size of the eddies generated by the above process is a function of {$\beta$}. It is given by [768g{${'}$}Q/{$\beta\pi$}f{$\mkern1mu$}2{$\alpha$}(2 - {$\alpha$})(1 + 2{$\alpha$})]1/5, where g{${'}$} is the reduced gravity. This gives a reasonable estimate for the Loop Current eddies' size and generation frequency. Numerical simulations are in agreement with the above nonlinear solution, though the agreement is not necessarily any better than that of PN.},

  abstract = {The marine atmospheric boundary layer (MABL) response to sea surface temperature (SST) perturbations with wavelengths shorter than 30{\textdegree} longitude by 10{\textdegree} latitude along the Agulhas Return Current (ARC) is described from the first year of SST and cloud liquid water (CLW) measurements from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR) on the Earth Observing System (EOS) Aqua satellite and surface wind stress measurements from the QuikSCAT scatterometer. AMSR measurements of SST at a resolution of 58 km considerably improves upon a previous analysis that used the Reynolds SST analyses, which underestimate the short-scale SST gradient magnitude over the ARC region by more than a factor of 5. The AMSR SST data thus provide the first quantitatively accurate depiction of the SST-induced MABL response along the ARC. Warm (cold) SST perturbations produce positive (negative) wind stress magnitude perturbations, leading to short-scale perturbations in the wind stress curl and divergence fields that are linearly related to the crosswind and downwind components of the SST gradient, respectively. The magnitudes of the curl and divergence responses vary seasonally and spatially with a response nearly twice as strong during the winter than during the summer along a zonal band between 40{\textdegree} and 50{\textdegree}S. These seasonal variations closely correspond to seasonal and spatial variability of large-scale MABL stability and surface sensible heat flux estimated from NCEP reanalysis fields. SST-induced deepening of the MABL over warm water is evident in AMSR measurements of CLW. Typical annual mean differences in cloud thickness between cold and warm SST perturbations are estimated to be about 300 m.},

A total of 42 Tehuantepec and 26 Papagayo eddies were observed. Eddy merging, usually of a Tehuantepec-Papagayo pair, was observed on 16 occasions. On average, the eddy season began in late October and lasted approximately 250 days until early July, with 3.5 Tehuantepec and 2.2 Papagayo eddies formed each year. Minimum average eddy lifespan was 143 days and 84 days for Tehuantepec and Papagayo eddies, respectively. There was considerable interannual variability in eddy activity, with greater (fewer) number of eddies, more intense (weaker) eddies, and a longer (shorter) eddy season during El Ni{\~n}o (La Ni{\~n}a) years. Eddy intensification was consistently observed at the East Pacific Rise.},

  abstract = {The Humboldt Current System is the most productive of the eastern boundary currents. In the northern part, the Peru Current System (PCS) is located between 5{\textdegree}S and 20{\textdegree}S. Along the Peruvian coast, an equatorward wind forces a strong coastal upwelling. A high resolution model is designed to investigate the mean circulation, the seasonal cycle, and the mesoscale dynamics for the PCS. The model is able to reproduce the equatorward Peru Coastal Current (PCC), the Peru Chile Under-Current (PCUC) which follows the shelf break towards the pole, and the Peru-Chile Counter-Current (PCCC) which flows directly towards the south and veers to the west around 15{\textdegree}S. While the upper part of the PCUC is close to the surface and might even outcrop as a counter current, the bottom part follows isolines. The PCCC appears to be directly forced by the cyclonic wind stress curl. The model is able to produce the upwelling front, the cold water tongue which extends toward the equator and the equatorial front as described in the literature. Model seasonal changes in SST and SSH are compared to measurements. For the central PCS, model EKE is 10\% to 30\% lower than the observations. The model eddy diameters follow a strong equatorward increase. The injection length scales, derived from the energy spectra, strongly correlate to the Rossby radius of deformation, confirming the predominant role of baroclinic instability. At 3{\textdegree}S, the model solution appears to switch from a turbulent oceanic regime to an equatorial regime dominated by zonal currents.},

  abstract = {Basin-scale heat transport induced by mesoscale oceanic eddies is estimated by combining satellitederived sea surface height and temperature [temperature data are from the TRMM Microwave Imager (TMI)] data with Argo float temperature{\textendash}salinity data. In the North Pacific Ocean subtropical gyre, warm (cold) temperature anomalies of mesoscale eddies are found to be consistently located to the west of high (low) SSH anomalies. The phase misalignment between the temperature and velocity anomalies, however, is largely confined to the seasonal thermocline, causing most of the eddy-induced heat transport to be carried in the surface 200-m layer. By establishing a statistical relationship between the surface and depthintegrated values of the eddy heat transport, the basin-scale eddy heat transport is derived from the concurrent satellite SSH/SST data of the past six years. In the Kuroshio Extension region, the meandering zonal jet is found to generate oppositely signed eddy heat fluxes. As a result, the zonally integrated poleward heat transport associated with the Kuroshio Extension is at a level O(0.1 PW), smaller than the previous estimates based on turbulent closure schemes. Large poleward eddy heat transport is also found in the subtropical North Pacific along a southwest{\textendash}northeast-tilting band between Taiwan and the Midway Islands. This band corresponds to the region of the subtropical front, and it is argued that the relevant temperature field for identifying this band in the turbulent closure scheme models should be that averaged over the seasonal thermocline.},

  abstract = {Twelve years of sea surface height (SSH) data from multiple satellite altimeters are used to investigate the low-frequency changes and the interconnections of the Kuroshio Extension (KE) jet, its southern recirculation gyre, and their mesoscale eddy field. The dominant signal is characterized by the steady weakening of the KE jet/recirculation gyre from 1993 to 1996, followed by a gradual strengthening after 1997. During the weakening period of 1993{\textendash}96, the KE path migrated southward in general, and this path migration reversed in direction during the strengthening period of the KE jet and recirculation gyre after 1997. By hindcasting the SSH signals using linear vorticity dynamics, it was found that weakening (strengthening) in the KE jet and recirculation gyre is consistent with westward propagation of negative (positive) SSH anomalies generating in the eastern North Pacific and strengthening during their westward propagation. When the KE jet and recirculation gyre were in a weak mode during 1996{\textendash}2001, the regional eddy kinetic energy level was observed to be higher than when the jet and recirculation gyre were in a strong mode. This negative correlation between the mean flow intensity and the level of regional eddy kinetic energy is found in both the SSH data and the linear vorticity model to result from the migration of the KE jet inflow over the Izu{\textendash}Ogasawara Ridge. When it is forced southward by the impinging negative SSH anomalies, the KE jet inflow rides over the ridge through a shallow segment, leading to large-amplitude downstream meanders. Impinging of positive SSH anomalies, on the other hand, strengthens the recirculation gyre and forces the inflow northward where it passes through a deep channel, minimizing the path perturbations in the downstream region.},

  abstract = {Sea surface height measurements from satellites reveal the turbulent properties of the South Pacific Ocean surface geostrophic circulation, both supporting and challenging different aspects of geostrophic turbulence theory. A near-universal shape of the spectral kinetic energy flux is found and provides direct evidence of a source of kinetic energy near to or smaller than the deformation radius, consistent with linear instability theory. The spectral kinetic energy flux also reveals a net inverse cascade (i.e., a cascade to larger spatial scale), consistent with two-dimensional turbulence phenomenology. However, stratified geostrophic turbulence theory predicts an inverse cascade for the barotropic mode only; energy in the large-scale baroclinic modes undergoes a direct cascade toward the first-mode deformation scale. Thus if the surface geostrophic flow is predominately the first baroclinic mode, as expected for oceanic stratification profiles, then the observed inverse cascade contradicts geostrophic turbulence theory. The latter interpretation is argued for. Furthermore, and consistent with this interpretation, the inverse cascade arrest scale does not follow the Rhines arrest scale, as one would expect for the barotropic mode. A tentative revision of theory is proposed that would resolve the conflicts; however, further observations and idealized modeling experiments are needed to confirm, or refute, the revision. It is noted that no inertial range was found for the inverse cascade range of the spectrum, implying inertial range scaling, such as the established KϪ5/3 slope in the spectral kinetic energy density plot, is not applicable to the surface geostrophic flow.},

SST effects on near-surface stability and surface wind variations are examined in this region using satellite and in situ datasets. Satellite observations show strong (weak) surface wind speeds over the warm Brazil (cold Malvinas) Current. A novel feature of this study is the construction of a high-resolution surface meteorological dataset that is based on historical ship observations. Analysis of this new in situ dataset reveals an increased (reduced) sea{\textendash}air temperature difference over the Brazil (Malvinas) Current, indicating destabilization (stabilization) in the atmospheric boundary layer. These results are consistent with the SST-induced vertical mixing mechanism for wind adjustment. The SST effect on the near-surface atmosphere is observed both in the climatology and on interannual time scales in the Brazil{\textendash}Malvinas confluence. Along a zonal SST front at 49{\textdegree}S northeast of the Malvinas/ Falkland Islands, there is a collocated line of surface wind divergence, with moderate convergence to the north. Vertical mixing does not explain this divergence pattern because the prevailing surface winds are westerly, blowing in parallel with the front. An additional mechanism is proposed for boundary layer wind adjustment.},

Could the Kuroshio form a loop current west of the Luzon Strait inside the SCS when the Kuro shio intrudes into the SCS?Up to now the problem remains untouched,especially the studies about their dynamic mechanism.For solving above problems,it is very necessary to get the long-term observed currents and hydrographic data and the longterm sa ellite remote data from the cooperative program in the Luzon Strait in the future.In the region east of Taiwan,the MSE always occur in the both sides of Kuroshio,and their variability is large and complex.The following two cyclonic cold eddies are discussed mainly:the Lanyu cold eddy and the cyclonic cold eddy northeast of Taiwan.},

  abstract = {A 1{$\fracslash$}18{\textdegree} nested ocean model is used to determine locations, volume transports, and temporal variations of Kuroshio onshore fluxes across the shelf break of the East China Sea (ECS). The Kuroshio onshore flux shows strong seasonality: maximum (ϳ3 Sv; 1 Sv {$\epsilon$} 106 m3 sϪ1) in autumn and minimum (Ͻ0.5 Sv) in summer. Another short-term (ϳ17 days) variation due to Kuroshio meanders introduces large fluctuations in the onshore fluxes but its seasonal average almost vanishes. The Kuroshio onshore fluxes have two major sources, Kuroshio intrusion northeast of Taiwan and Kuroshio separation southwest of Kyushu; the former provides larger onshore flux than the latter. Therefore, in addition to the waters from the Taiwan Strait and the Kuroshio separation region southwest of Kyushu, the water due to the Kuroshio intrusion northeast of Taiwan is also a major source of the Tsushima Warm Current. A vorticity equation is used to separate the contribution of surface Ekman transport to the Kuroshio onshore fluxes in the ECS from that relating to density fields. For the total Kuroshio onshore flux across the entire shelf break, its seasonal variation is primarily controlled by the Ekman transport while the change in density field is secondary. For the Kuroshio onshore flux at a fixed location along the shelf break, its seasonal variation is primarily related to the change in density field and the Ekman transport is secondary. Furthermore, the role of the Taiwan Strait water and the Kuroshio water across the shelf break on material transport in the ECS is examined with passive tracer experiments. In summer, about half of the tracer in the Tsushima Strait originates in the Taiwan Strait, while the other half comes from the Kuroshio. From summer to winter, the ratio changes dramatically; the contribution from the Taiwan Strait decreases to 20\% and that from the Kuroshio increases up to 80\%. The tracer originating in the Kuroshio water dominates the bottom layer of the continental shelf in the ECS throughout the year.},

  abstract = {The presence of coherent vortices makes observed mesoscale fields of the ocean resemble twodimensional turbulence. Using this analogy, a common definition of a coherent structure has been used to study the statistical properties of Mediterranean Sea vortices observed by satellite altimeters over a 7-yr period. A vortex has been defined as the simply connected region with values of the Okubo{\textendash}Weiss parameter W Ͻ Ϫ0.2␴W, where ␴W is the spatial standard deviation of W, and the same sign of vorticity. This definition is shown to be appropriate to detect and characterize, statistically, properties such as size, mean kinetic energy, and amplitude of vortices in the Mediterranean basin from sea level anomaly maps corresponding to the period from October 1992 to October 1999. The distribution of such properties for the Mediterranean vortices suggests a heuristic criterion to extract and select very coherent and long-lived vortices from the whole set of structures identified in altimetric maps. Such coherent vortices appear to be selected for amplitudes greater than 2␴W, where the amplitude has been defined in terms of the Okubo{\textendash}Weiss parameter rather than vorticity, and strongly correspond to those reported from observations with independent data. Systematic locating and tracking of such vortices provide, for the first time, a general picture of their preferential paths in the Mediterranean basin, which are characterized by complex but rather well defined patterns.},

They roughly coincide with the Subarctic Front (SAF) defined as the 4{\textdegree}C isotherm at 100 m depth. The phenomena appear throughout the year with seasonal cycles, which do not correspond with that of the subarctic North Pacific. Their positions are affected by bottom topography so that their quasi-stationary and consistent features are suggested. Thus it is implied that these jets play an important role in transporting warm waters toward the subarctic region. The time series of SST and current fields describe the jets' year-to-year variability involving some changes in strength and connections with the Kuroshio Extension (KE), and demonstrate the effects of advection by the jets on SST fields. When KE extends northward at its crests for 1999{\textendash}2002, one of the jets along SAF simultaneously strengthens, resulting in high SST region directly over and along the south side of the jet. Hydrographic data show warm, saline water intrusions along the jets. Their mean fields also reveal that these jets are vertically well-developed, forming a boundary between the subtropical and subarctic gyres in the North Pacific.},

  abstract = {Abstract In this study, the relation between the interior and the surface dynamics for nonlinear baroclinically unstable flows is examined using the concepts of potential vorticity. First, it is demonstrated that baroclinic unstable flows present the property that the potential vorticity mesoscale and submesoscale anomalies in the ocean interior are strongly correlated to the surface density anomalies. Then, using the invertibility of potential vorticity, the dynamics are decomposed in terms of a solution forced by the three-dimensional (3D) potential vorticity and a solution forced by the surface boundary condition in density. It is found that, in the upper oceanic layers, the balanced flow induced only by potential vorticity is strongly anticorrelated with that induced only by the surface density with a dominance of the latter. The major consequence is that the 3D balanced motions can be determined from only the surface density and the characteristics of the basin-scale stratification by solving an elliptic equation. These properties allow for the possibility to reconstruct the 3D balanced velocity field of the upper layers from just the knowledge of the surface density by using a simpler model, that is, an ``effective'' surface quasigeostrophic model. All these results are validated through the examination of a primitive equation simulation reproducing the dynamics of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current.},

  abstract = {We analyze model simulations of a wind-forced upper ocean front to understand the generation of near-surface submesoscale, O(1 km), structures with intense vertical motion. The largest vertical velocities are in the downward direction; their maxima are situated at approximately 25 m depth and magnitudes exceed 1 mm/s or 100 m/day. They are correlated with high rates of lateral strain, large relative vorticity and the loss of geostrophic balance. We examine several mechanisms for the formation of submesoscale structure and vertical velocity in the upper ocean. These include: (i) frontogenesis, (ii) frictional effects at fronts, (iii) mixed layer instabilities, (iv) ageostrophic anticyclonic instability, and (v) nonlinear Ekman effects. We assess the role of these mechanisms in generating vertical motion within the nonlinear, three-dimensionally evolving flow field of the nonhydrostatic model. We find that the strong submesoscale down-welling in the model is explained by nonlinear Ekman pumping and is also consistent with the potential vorticity arguments that analogize down-front winds to buoyancy-forcing. Conditions also support the formation of ageostrophic anticyclonic instabilities, but the contribution of these is difficult to assess because the decomposition of the flow into balanced and unbalanced components via semigeostrophic analysis breaks down at O(1) Rossby numbers. Mixed layer instabilities do not dominate the structure, but shear and frontogenesis contribute to the relative vorticity and strain fields that generate ageostrophy. {\'O} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Winds over the Southern Ocean have shown a strong climatic increase over the past few decades. If this increase in winds is also reflected as an increase in eddy activity (as our analysis suggests it might), then the increased poleward heat flux may have played a significant role in the observed warming of the Southern Ocean.},

Inside the Kuroshio Extension (KE) recirculation gyre where STMW forms, the dominant signal is characterized by a gradual thinning in the late winter mixed layer depth and in the 16{\textdegree}{\textendash}18{\textdegree}C thermostad layer from 1993 to 1999 and a subsequent steady thickening of these features after 2000. This same decadal signal is also seen in the low-potential-vorticity (PV) STMW layer in the interior subtropical gyre south of the recirculation gyre. By analyzing the air{\textendash}sea flux data from the NCEP{\textendash}NCAR reanalysis project, little correlation is found between the decadal STMW signal and the year-to-year changes in the cumulative wintertime surface cooling. In contrast, the decadal signal is found to be closely related to variability in the dynamic state of the KE system. Specifically, STMW formation is reduced when the KE path is in a variable state, during which time high regional eddy variability infuses high-PV KE water into the recirculation gyre, increasing the upper-ocean stratification and hindering the development of a deep winter mixed layer. A stable KE path, on the other hand, favors the maintenance of a weak stratification, leading to a deep winter mixed layer and formation of a thick STMW layer. The relative importance of the surface air{\textendash}sea flux forcing versus the preconditioning stratification in controlling the variations in the late winter mixed layer depth is quantified using both a simple upper-ocean heat conservation model and a bulk mixed layer model. The majority of the variance (ϳ80\%) is found to be due to the stratification changes controlled by the dynamic state of the KE system.},

The presence of an enhanced recirculation gyre and relatively low mesoscale eddy variability rendered this year favorable for the formation of STMW.

The lower boundary of STMW, corresponding to ␴␪ Ӎ 25.5 kg mϪ3, was set by the maximum depth of the late-winter mixed layer. Properties within the deep portions of the STMW layer remained largely unchanged as the season progressed. In contrast, the upper boundary of the STMW layer eroded steadily as the seasonal thermocline deepened from late April to August. Vertical eddy diffusivity responsible for this erosion was estimated from a budget analysis of potential vorticity to be in the range of ϳ2{\textendash}5 ϫ 10Ϫ4 m2 sϪ1. The latitudinal extent of the STMW formation was narrow, extending from 30{\textdegree}N to the Kuroshio Extension jet near 35{\textdegree}N.

  abstract = {The restratification of the oceanic surface mixed layer that results from lateral gradients in the surface density field is studied. The lateral gradients are shown to be unstable to ageostrophic baroclinic instabilities and slump from the horizontal to the vertical. These instabilities, which are referred to as mixed layer instabilities (MLIs), differ from instabilities in the ocean interior because of the weak surface stratification. Spatial scales are O(1{\textendash}10) km, and growth time scales are on the order of a day. Linear stability analysis and fully nonlinear simulations are used to study MLIs and their impact on mixed layer restratification. The main result is that MLIs are a leading-order process in the ML heat budget acting to constantly restratify the surface ocean. Climate and regional ocean models do not resolve the scales associated with MLIs and are likely to underestimate the rate of ML restratification and consequently suffer from a bias in sea surface temperatures and ML depths. In a forthcoming paper, the authors discuss a parameterization scheme to include the effect of MLIs in ocean models.},

  abstract = {Density stratification and planetary rotation distinguish three-dimensional island wakes significantly from a classical fluid dynamical flow around an obstacle. A numerical model is used to study the formation and evolution of flow around an idealized island in deep water (i.e., with vertical island sides and surfaceintensified stratification and upstream flow), focusing on wake instability, coherent vortex formation, and mesoscale and submesoscale eddy activity. In a baseline experiment with strong vorticity generation at the island, three types of instability are evident: centrifugal, barotropic, and baroclinic. Sensitivities are shown to three nondimensional parameters: the Reynolds number (Re), Rossby number (Ro), and Burger number (Bu). The dependence on Re is similar to the classical wake in its transition to turbulence, but in contrast the island wake contains coherent eddies no matter how large the Re value. When Re is large enough, the shear layer at the island is so narrow that the vertical component of vorticity is larger than the Coriolis frequency in the near wake, leading to centrifugal instability on the anticyclonic side. As Bu decreases the eddy size shrinks from the island breadth to the baroclinic deformation radius, and the eddy generation process shifts from barotropic to baroclinic instability. For small Ro values, the wake dynamics is symmetric with respect to cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies. At intermediate Ro and Bu values, the anticyclonic eddies are increasingly more robust than cyclonic ones as Ro/Bu increases, but for large Re and Ro values, centrifugal instability weakens the anticyclonic eddies while cyclonic eddies remain coherent.},

Temperature/salinity profiles from Argo floats are used to derive the mixed layer depth. All terms in the heat budget are estimated directly from available data. The domain-averaged terms of oceanic heat advection, entrainment, diffusion, and air{\textendash}sea flux are largely consistent with the evolution of the mixed layer temperature. The mixed layer temperature undergoes a strong seasonal cycle, which is largely attributed to the air{\textendash}sea heat fluxes. Entrainment plays a secondary role. Oceanic advection also experiences a seasonal cycle, although it is relatively weak. Most of the seasonal variations in the advection term come from the Ekman advection, in contrast with western boundary current regions where geostrophic advection controls the total advection. Substantial imbalances exist in the regional heat budgets, especially near the northern boundary of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. The biggest contributor to the surface heat budget error is thought to be the air{\textendash}sea heat fluxes, because only limited Southern Hemisphere data are available for the reanalysis products, and hence these fluxes have large uncertainties. In particular, the lack of in situ measurements during winter is of fundamental concern. Sensitivity tests suggest that a proper representation of the mixed layer depth is important to close the budget. Salinity influences the stratification in the Southern Ocean; temperature alone provides an imperfect estimate of mixed layer depth and, because of this, also an imperfect estimate of the temperature of water entrained into the mixed layer from below.},

  abstract = {Observations of deep currents, from a closely spaced array deployed at the base of the Sigsbee Escarpment, south of the Mississippi Delta, are dominated by energetic, short-period (ϳ10 days) topographic Rossby waves. Over a 2-yr interval, distinct trains of waves occurred, with differing characteristic periods, wavelengths, and horizontal energy distribution, usually initiated with a burst of large-amplitude current fluctuations that slowly decay over the next 2{\textendash}3 months. Two of the wave trains were associated with the shedding and westward passage of major Loop Current anticyclones; however, one event occurred when upper-layer currents were quiescent. This latter wave train showed that bottom-trapped topographic wave motions can be traced to within 300 m of the surface in a 2000-m water column. Ray tracing showed that a likely source region of the short-period waves was the west side of an extended Loop Current. The data and ray paths suggest that, through refraction and reflection, the steep escarpment keeps the energetic waves confined to the deep water. These mechanisms help to explain why short-period fluctuations are not observed farther west in the central and western gulf basin.},

The generation mechanism and the conditions for the stability of a quasi-permanent vortex in the center of the Lofoten Basin are studied with a high-resolution ocean circulation model and altimeter data. The vortex and its generation mechanism manifest themselves by a pronounced sea surface height (SSH) signature and variability, which are found to be in agreement with altimeter data. The vortex results primarily from anticyclonic eddies shed from the eastern branch of the Norwegian Atlantic Current, which propagate southwestward. The largescale bottom depression of the Lofoten Basin plays a crucial role for attracting anticyclones into the trough and for enabling the dynamical stability of the vortex. The water mass characteristics of the anticyclone lead to enhanced atmospheric interaction (heat loss) during wintertime. The cold water trapped in the upper part of the vortex preconditions convection in the following winter. This positive feedback mechanism tends to deepen convection progressively within the upper part of the vortex.},

  abstract = {Forty-eight profiling floats have been deployed in the Kuroshio Extension (KE) region since May 2004 as part of the Kuroshio Extension System Study (KESS) project. By combining the float temperature{\textendash}salinity measurements with satellite altimetry data, this study investigates the role played by mesoscale eddies in controlling the property changes in North Pacific Subtropical Mode Water (STMW). Following a 3-yr period of low eddy activity in 2002{\textendash}04, the KE showed a transition to a high eddy kinetic energy state in 2005. This transition is the result of delayed oceanic response to the 2002 shift in the basin-scale surface wind forcing in connection with the Pacific decadal oscillation. The high eddy kinetic energy state of the KE is characterized by successive shedding of strong cold-core rings into the recirculation gyre, resulting from the interaction of the KE jet with the Shatsky Rise or the preexisting cutoff rings. By transporting northernorigin, high-potential-vorticity (PV) KE water into the recirculation gyre, the enhanced eddy activity affects STMW in two ways: first, it hinders the formation of deep winter mixed layer (hence the source for STMW) by modifying the upper-ocean stratification and, second, it provides a direct high-PV source to mix with the surrounding low-PV STMW. The eddies' influence upon STMW is observed to be both significant in magnitude and efficient in time. Relative to 2004, the PV signal in the core of STMW was reduced by one-half in 2005, and this weakening of STMW's intensity occurred within a period of less than 7 months. This result supports recent findings by the authors based on historical temperature data that the variability in STMW formation depends more sensitively on the dynamic state of the KE than on the overlying atmospheric conditions.},

Its distribution is highly dependent on eddies, and where it was renewed during the previous winter. Although the potential vorticity fluxes associated with down-front winds can be of the same order of magnitude or even greater than the diabatic ones due to air{\textendash}sea temperature differences, the latter dominate the potential vorticity budget on regional and larger scales.

The pycnostad is denser, colder and fresher than those of the North Pacific Central Mode Water and different from those of other known mode waters in the North Pacific. The thickness of the pycnostad is comparable to that of other mode waters, spreading over an area of at least 650 {\texttimes} 500 km around 43{\textdegree}N and 160{\textdegree}E in the western transition region. Hence, we refer to the pycnostad as Transition Region Mode Water (TRMW). Oxygen data, geostrophic current speed and climatology of mixed layer depth in the winter suggest that the TRMW is formed regularly in the deep winter mixed layer near the region where it was observed. Analysis of surface heat flux also supports the idea and suggests that there is significant interannual variability in the property of the TRMW. The TRMW is consistently distributed between the Subarctic Boundary and the Subarctic Front. It is also characterized by a wide T-S range with similar density, which is the characteristic of such a transition region between subtropical and subarctic water masses, which forms a density-compensating temperature and salinity front. The frontal nature also tends to cause isopycnal intrusions within the pycnostad of the TRMW.},

  abstract = {As in the midlatitude atmosphere, midocean eddies are primarily generated by baroclinically unstable mean currents. In contrast to the atmosphere, however, oceanic currents are significantly nonzonal. Even weak nonzonal currents are linearly unstable since ␤ does not suppress growing meridional waves. Theories for the nonlinear equilibration of baroclinic instability, and hence theories for the amplitudes of midocean eddies, must therefore take into account the different dynamics of nonzonal flow. It is shown here that the amplitude of fully developed baroclinic turbulence due to nonzonal shears differs from that due to zonal shears primarily in the nature of the eddy generation. Since ␤ will act to create large-scale zonal jet structures regardless of the generation source, the nature of eddy fluxes of potential vorticity (the source of eddy energy) in the zonal and meridional directions are fundamentally different. The cross-jet mixing has been shown previously to obey a mixing-length scaling, and this corresponds to the generation due to unstable zonal flow. The along-jet mixing, which corresponds to the generation due to the meridional shear, is shown here to be best described by a shear dispersion model. The resulting flux is orders of magnitude higher than in the cross-jet direction, and thus eddy energies driven by baroclinically unstable mean flows with a nonzero meridional component are much larger. This provides an explanation for recently reported results. Moreover, given recent observational and modeling studies showing the ubiquitous presence of zonal jets in the oceans, the results presented here indicate a powerful source of eddy energy.},

Linear baroclinic instability theory has proved useful in understanding the time and space scales of atmospheric eddies. The question addressed here is, to what degree can the observed oceanic eddy activity be understood through a local, linear stability analysis? This question is addressed as follows. A local quasigeostrophic linear stability calculation is performed on a grid of wavenumbers, ranging in magnitude about the local deformation wavenumber, for each vertical profile in a dataset of neutral density for the world's oceans. The initial results show that nearly the entire ocean is unstable, but in many places, particularly in low latitudes, the instability is dominated by surface intensified modes, resulting in very small-scale, quickly growing waves. At higher latitudes, the primary instabilities are due to thermocline depth shears and have a broader vertical structure. For each unstable wave, at each location, the mean-to-eddy energy conversion rate is also calculated and used to select the growing waves that are both fast and have significant energetic conversion potential. This procedure removes most of the surface-instabilities, which cannot lead to significant energy conversion, and reveals the slower but more powerful thermocline-level instabilities where they exist.},

In both the OFES hindcast and satellite altimeter observations, low-frequency sea surface height (SSH) variability in the North Pacific is high near the KE front. An empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis indicates that much of the SSH variability in the western North Pacific east of Japan is explained by two modes with meridional structures tightly trapped along the KE front. The first mode represents a southward shift and to a lesser degree, an acceleration of the KE jet associated with the 1976/77 shift in basin-scale winds. The second mode reflects quasi-decadal variations in the intensity of the KE jet.

In spite of the close analogy between 2D turbulence and geophysical fluid dynamics, few works have tried to generalize the rich framework of wavelet techniques to the study of experimental signals in oceanography. In this paper, the authors extend a prominent wavelet technique designed for the study of direct numerical simulations (DNSs) on 2D turbulence, the coherent vortex simulation, and analyze with it ocean velocity fields obtained from sea surface height maps derived from satellite altimetry. The authors demonstrate the pertinence of this technique to describe altimetry data, resulting in a description of oceanic flows with a reduced number of degrees of freedom. In particular, it is shown that the western Mediterranean circulation is well approximated by a field of extracted coherent vortices when an appropriate wavelet basis is employed as a filter; however, about one-third of the energy is lost in this description, evidencing important differences between results obtained on the frame of 2D turbulence and oceanic data.},

  abstract = {The propagation velocity and propagation mechanism for vortices on a ␤ plane are determined for a reduced-gravity model by integrating the momentum equations over the ␤ plane. Isolated vortices, vortices in a background current, and initial vortex propagation from rest are studied. The propagation mechanism for isolated anticyclones as well as cyclones, which has been lacking up to now, is presented. It is shown that, to first order, the vortex moves to generate a Coriolis force on the mass anomaly of the vortex to compensate for the force on the vortex due to the variation of the Coriolis parameter. Only the mass anomaly of the vortex is of importance, because the Coriolis force due to the motion of the bulk of the layer moving with the vortex is almost fully compensated by the Coriolis force on the motion of the exterior flow. Because the mass anomaly of a cyclone is negative the force and acceleration have opposite sign. The role of dipolar structures in steadily moving vortices is discussed, and it is shown that their overall structure is fixed by the steady westward motion of the mass anomaly. Furthermore, it is shown that reduced-gravity vortices are not advected with a background flow. The reason for this behavior is that the background flow changes the ambient vorticity gradient such that the vortex obtains an extra self-propagation term that exactly cancels the advection by the background flow. Last, it is shown that a vortex initially at rest will accelerate equatorward first, after which a westward motion is generated. This result is independent of the sign of the vortex.},

  abstract = {Along the Taiwan Strait (Ͻ100 m in depth) a northeastward flow persists in all seasons despite the annually averaged wind stress that is strongly southwestward. The forcing mechanism of this countercurrent is examined by using a simple ocean model. The results from a suite of experiments demonstrate that it is the Kuroshio that plays the deciding role for setting the flow direction along the Taiwan Strait. The momentum balance along the strait is mainly between the wind stress, friction, and pressure gradient. Since both wind stress and friction act against the northward flow, it is most likely the pressure gradient that forces the northward flow, as noted in some previous studies. What remains unknown is why there is a considerable pressure difference between the southern and northern strait. The Kuroshio flows along the east coast of Taiwan, and thus the western boundary current layer dynamics applies there. Integrating the momentum equation along Taiwan's east coast shows that there must be a pressure difference between the southern and the northern tip of Taiwan to counter a considerable friction exerted by the mighty Kuroshio. This same pressure difference is also felt on the other side of the island where it forces the northward flow through Taiwan Strait. The model shows that the local wind stress acts to dampen this northward flow. This mechanism can be illustrated by an integral constraint for flow around an island.},

Specifically, our analysis is based on extracting Lagrangian coherent structures (LCSs) from finite-time Lyapunov exponent (FTLE) fields. The FTLE fields reveal with unprecedented detail an intricate tangle of LCSs, which are hidden in ocean surface topography maps but sometimes are apparent in ocean color images. These LCSs delineate fluid domains with very different advective properties, and thus their detection provides an objective (i.e., frame-independent) means of identifying eddy boundaries. The importance of considering LCSs in quantifying transport by eddies is highlighted. Such a quantification does not rely on the common assumption{\textemdash}which is shown to be generally not valid{\textemdash}that transport is largely effected by the trapping and subsequent translation of water slugs inside eddies defined as the regions enclosed by sea height (streamfunction) contours within which rotation dominates over strain. LCSs are calculated for the whole globe and compared with satellite-tracked drogue drifter trajectories within a selected region of the South Atlantic.},

The emergent upper-ocean submesoscale fronts are analyzed from phenomenological and dynamical perspectives, using a combination of composite averaging and separation of distinctive subregions of the flow. The initiating dynamical process for the transition is near-surface frontogenesis. The frontal behavior is similar to both observed meteorological surface fronts and solutions of the approximate dynamical model called surface dynamics (i.e., uniform interior potential vorticity q and diagnostic force balance) in the intensification of surface density gradients and secondary circulations in response to a mesoscale strain field. However, there are significant behavioral differences compared to the surfacedynamics model. Wind stress acts on fronts through nonlinear Ekman transport and creation and destruction of potential vorticity. The strain-induced frontogenesis is disrupted by vigorous submesoscale frontal instabilities that in turn lead to secondary frontogenesis events, submesoscale vortices, and excitation of even smaller-scale flows. Intermittent, submesoscale breakdown of geostrophic and gradient-wind force balance occurs during the intense frontogenesis and frontal-instability events.},

  abstract = {In computational simulations of an idealized subtropical eastern boundary upwelling current system, similar to the California Current, a submesoscale transition occurs in the eddy variability as the horizontal grid scale is reduced to O(1) km. This first paper (in a series of three) describes the transition in terms of the emergent flow structure and the associated time-averaged eddy fluxes. In addition to the mesoscale eddies that arise from a primary instability of the alongshore, wind-driven currents, significant energy is transferred into submesoscale fronts and vortices in the upper ocean. The submesoscale arises through surface frontogenesis growing off upwelled cold filaments that are pulled offshore and strained in between the mesoscale eddy centers. In turn, some submesoscale fronts become unstable and develop submesoscale meanders and fragment into roll-up vortices. Associated with this phenomenon are a large vertical vorticity and Rossby number, a large vertical velocity, relatively flat horizontal spectra (contrary to the prevailing view of mesoscale dynamics), a large vertical buoyancy flux acting to restratify the upper ocean, a submesoscale energy conversion from potential to kinetic, a significant spatial and temporal intermittency in the upper ocean, and material exchanges between the surface boundary layer and pycnocline. Comparison with available observations indicates that submesoscale fronts and instabilities occur widely in the upper ocean, with characteristics similar to the simulations.},

The transition is mainly explained by the emergence of ubiquitous submesoscale density fronts and ageostrophic circulations about them in the weakly stratified surface boundary layer. Here the highresolution simulations are further analyzed from the perspective of the kinetic energy (KE) spectrum shape and spectral energy fluxes in the mesoscale-to-submesoscale range in the upper ocean. For wavenumbers greater than the mesoscale energy peak, there is a submesoscale power-law regime in the spectrum with an exponent close to Ϫ2. In the KE balance an important conversion from potential to kinetic energy takes place at all wavenumbers in both mesoscale and submesoscale ranges; this conversion is the energetic counterpart of the vertical restratification flux and frontogenesis discussed in the earlier papers. A significant forward cascade of KE occurs in the submesoscale range en route to dissipation at even smaller scales. This is contrary to the inverse energy cascade of geostrophic turbulence and it is, in fact, fundamentally associated with the horizontally divergent (i.e., ageostrophic) velocity component. The submesoscale dynamical processes of frontogenesis, frontal instability, and breakdown of diagnostic force balance are all essential elements of the energy cycle of potential energy conversion and forward KE cascade.},

In June 2004, an NOAA surface mooring, referred to as the Kuroshio Extension Observatory (KEO), was deployed in the Kuroshio Extension's (KE) southern recirculation gyre, approximately 300 nautical miles east of Japan. In 2006, a partnership between NOAA and the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology was formed that deployed a second mooring (referred to as JKEO) north of the KE jet in February 2007. KE is a region of strong currents, typhoons, and winter storms. Designing and maintaining moorings in the KE is a challenging engineering task. All data are publicly available. A subset of the data are telemetered and made available in near real time through the Global Telecommunications System and web-based data distribution systems. Data from these time-series reference sites serve a wide research and operational community and are being used for assessing numerical weather prediction analyses and reanalyses and for quantifying the air{\textendash}sea interaction in this dynamic region.},

Away from the surface and bottom boundary layers, depth-averaging measured velocity is an excellent estimate of barotropic tidal flow, and internal tidal dynamics can be well represented by the difference between the measured currents and their depth average in the vertical. However, in shallow and/or energetic tidal environments such as the shelf of the South Atlantic Bight (SAB), bottom boundary layers can occupy a significant fraction of the water column, and depth averaging through the bottom boundary layer can overestimate the barotropic current by several tens of centimeters per second near bottom. The depth-averaged current fails to capture the bottom boundary layer structure associated with the barotropic tidal signal, and the resultant estimate of baroclinic tidal currents can mimic a bottom-trapped internal tide.},

The parameterization is cast as an overturning streamfunction that is proportional to the product of horizontal buoyancy gradient, mixed layer depth, and inertial period. The parameterization has remarkable skill for an extremely wide range of mixed layer depths, rotation rates, and vertical and horizontal stratifications. In this paper a coarse resolution prognostic model of the parameterization is compared with submesoscale mixed layer eddy resolving simulations. The parameterization proves accurate in predicting changes to the buoyancy. The climate implications of the proposed parameterization are estimated by applying the restratification scaling to observations: the mixed layer depth is estimated from climatology, and the buoyancy gradients are from satellite altimetry. The vertical fluxes are comparable to monthly mean air{\textendash}sea fluxes in large areas of the ocean and suggest that restratification by mixed layer eddies is a leading order process in the upper ocean. Critical regions for ocean{\textendash}atmosphere interaction, such as deep, intermediate, and mode water formation sites, are particularly affected.},

  abstract = {Ageostrophic baroclinic instabilities develop within the surface mixed layer of the ocean at horizontal fronts and efficiently restratify the upper ocean. In this paper a parameterization for the restratification driven by finite-amplitude baroclinic instabilities of the mixed layer is proposed in terms of an overturning streamfunction that tilts isopycnals from the vertical to the horizontal. The streamfunction is proportional to the product of the horizontal density gradient, the mixed layer depth squared, and the inertial period. Hence restratification proceeds faster at strong fronts in deep mixed layers with a weak latitude dependence. In this paper the parameterization is theoretically motivated, confirmed to perform well for a wide range of mixed layer depths, rotation rates, and vertical and horizontal stratifications. It is shown to be superior to alternative extant parameterizations of baroclinic instability for the problem of mixed layer restratification. Two companion papers discuss the numerical implementation and the climate impacts of this parameterization.},

Here, the distribution of ocean surface cyclonic and anticyclonic motion is computed from global drifter observations for scales from large eddies to submesoscale. Two zonal bands of small-scale motion are recovered: a known anticyclonic band at 30{\textdegree}{\textendash}40{\textdegree} latitude, mostly wind-induced, and an unexpected cyclonic band at 10{\textdegree}{\textendash}20{\textdegree} latitude. It is suggested that this is due to submesoscale processes related to salinity front instabilities. These results provide a first global view of the upper ocean including these motions.},

  abstract = {In the Gulf of Alaska (GOA), mesoscale eddies play an important role in promoting off-shelf transport of heat, nutrients and biological populations into the HNLC water of the northeast Pacific Ocean. However, the spatial and temporal distribution of these eddies and their characteristics have not been substantially described. Here we apply an objective method (Okubo{\textendash}Weiss parameter) for identifying and tracking eddies to 15 years (October 1992{\textendash}2006) of satellite sea level anomaly data. The parameter allows the spatial and temporal variability in eddy activity to be defined, providing the first systematic census of anticyclonic eddies in the region. Eddies are generated principally on the eastern side of the basin and propagate either westward (Haida eddies) or along the western GOA shelf break (Alaskan Stream eddies). Seasonal maps of eddy density show fewest eddies in winter, maximum in spring/summer. The Haida and Alaskan Stream eddy corridors are clearly defined, as is an `eddy desert' in the southwest of the basin, where the probability of an eddy being identified is zero. Maps of eddy trajectories for each year show substantial interannual variability in number and propagation paths. Greatest eddy activity occurs in 1994, 1997/1998 and 2004. Fewest eddies occur in 1996 and in the period from 1999 through 2002. Interannual variability in eddy characteristics (magnitude, propagation speed, diameter and duration) is assessed for the basin as a whole, and separately for the Alaskan Stream, Haida and Sitka/Yakutat formation regions. In general, Alaskan Stream eddies are more numerous, larger and more intense than Haida eddies. Periods of increased eddy activity do not necessarily correspond to El Ni{\~n}o events, but are associated with anomalous downwelling wind conditions along the continental margin.},

  abstract = {The authors examine the turbulent properties of a baroclinically unstable oceanic flow using primitive equation (PE) simulations with high resolution (in both horizontal and vertical directions). Resulting dynamics in the surface layers involve large Rossby numbers and significant vortical asymmetries. Furthermore, the ageostrophic divergent motions associated with small-scale surface frontogenesis are shown to significantly alter the nonlinear transfers of kinetic energy and consequently the time evolution of the surface dynamics. Such impact of the ageostrophic motions explains the emergence of the significant cyclone{\textendash}anticyclone asymmetry and of a strong restratification in the upper layers, which are not allowed by the quasigeostrophic (QG) or surface quasigeostrophic (SQG) theory. However, despite this strong ageostrophic character, some of the main surface properties are surprisingly still close to the surface quasigeostrophic equilibrium. They include a noticeable shallow (ϷkϪ2) velocity spectrum as well as a conspicuous local spectral relationship between surface kinetic energy, sea surface height, and density variance over a large range of scales (from 400 to 4 km). Furthermore, surface velocities can be remarkably diagnosed from only the surface density using SQG relations. This suggests that the validity of some specific SQG relations extends to dynamical regimes with large Rossby numbers. The interior dynamics, on the other hand, strongly differ from the surface dynamics, involving a small Rossby number, a steep (ϷkϪ4) velocity spectrum, and a somewhat steeper density spectrum. The compensation of the surface restratification by a destratification at depth confirms a connection between the surface and the interior induced by the small-scale divergent motions.},

Lag correlation analysis reveals that positive anomalies both in basin-scale wind stress curl and in local Ekman pumping can intensify the southward Oyashio almost simultaneously via barotropic and baroclinic Rossby wave propagations, respectively. The Oyashio strength can also be influenced by anomalous Ekman pumping that is exerted in the western portion of the basin through the baroclinic wave propagation with the lag of 3 yr, which appears to arise from a periodicity in the wind field. The intensification of the Oyashio is accompanied by negative anomalies both in the sea surface temperature and height off of Hokkaido Island of Japan and is followed by their eastward development along the southern branch of the Oyashio Extension and associated subarctic frontal zone in association with a southward displacement of their axes. These changes are associated with cool sea surface temperature anomalies and low potential vorticity anomalies at the thermocline level in the frontal zone. The surface cooling, thus induced in the frontal zone by those oceanic processes, accompanies anomalous downward surface heat fluxes, indicative of ocean-to-atmosphere feedback forcing associated with the Oyashio variations.},

In this paper, results from a high-resolution numerical model of the Gulf are analyzed to explain their origin and how they excite topographic Rossby waves (TRWs) that disperse energy to the northern slopes of the Gulf. It is shown that north of Campeche Bank is a fertile ground for the growth of deep cyclones by baroclinic instability of the Loop Current. The cyclones have horizontal (vertical) scales of about 100 km (1000ϳ2000 m) and swirl speeds ϳ0.3 m sϪ1. The subsequent development of these cyclones consists of two modes, A and B. Mode-A cyclones evolve into the relatively well-known frontal eddies that propagate around the Loop Current. Mode-A cyclone can amplify off the west Florida slope and cause the Loop Current to develop a ``neck'' that sometimes leads to shedding of a ring; this process is shown to be the Loop Current's dominant mode of upper-to-deep variability. Mode-B cyclones are ``shed'' and propagate west-northwestward at speeds of about 2{\textendash}6 km dayϪ1, often in concert with an expanding loop or a migrating ring. TRWs are produced through wave{\textendash}eddy coupling originating primarily from the cyclone birthplace as well as from the mode-B cyclones, and second, but for longer periods of 20ϳ30 days only, also from the mode-A frontal eddies. The waves are ``channeled'' onto the northern slope by a deep ridge located over the lower slope. For very short periods (Շ10 days), the forcing is a short distance to the south, which suggests that the TRWs are locally forced by features that have intruded upslope and that most likely have accompanied the Loop Current or a ring.},

Hetons are dipoles, consisting of a surface cyclone and a weakly stratified subsurface anticyclone, that can be formed by convection. Here, key postconvective processes are investigated using numerical experiments of increasing sophistication with two primary goals: 1) to understand how the ambient hydrography and topography influence the propagation of hetons and 2) to provide a theoretical context for recent observations of SCVs in the Greenland Sea.},

A well-defined, cyclonic recirculation gyre (RG) is found to exist north of the Kuroshio Extension jet, confined zonally between the Japan Trench (ϳ145{\textdegree}E) and the Shatsky Rise (ϳ156{\textdegree}E), and bordered to the north by the subarctic boundary along ϳ40{\textdegree}N. This northern RG, which is simulated favorably in the eddy-resolving OGCM for the Earth Simulator (OFES) hindcast run model, has a maximum volume transport at 26.4 Sv across 159{\textdegree}E and its presence persists on the interannual and longer time scales. An examination of the time-mean x-momentum balance from the OFES hindcast run output reveals that horizontal convergence of Reynolds stresses works to accelerate both the eastward-flowing Kuroshio Extension jet and a westward mean flow north of the meandering jet. The fact that the northern RG is eddy driven is further confirmed by examining the turbulent Sverdrup balance, in which convergent eddy potential vorticity fluxes are found to induce the cyclonic RG across the background potential vorticity gradient field. For the strength of the simulated northern RG, the authors find the eddy dissipation effect to be important as well.},

Subsequent nonlinear eddy{\textendash}eddy interactions redistribute the EKE to larger total horizontal length scales, and larger zonal scales in particular. This is confirmed by diagnosing the spectral transfer of EKE in the surface geostrophic flow, which is found to drive an anisotropic inverse cascade, being redirected in the sense consistent with the ␤ effect, as predicted by geostrophic turbulence theory on the ␤ plane. Because of the seasonal renewal of meridionally elongated anomalies by baroclinic instability and possibly because of the barotropization process, however, the net outcome for the formation of surface zonal flows is observed to be limited.},

Thirteen years of altimetric sea level anomaly data are then added to reconstruct the time variable sea level, and this new dataset is analyzed to identify and monitor the position of the two main fronts of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) during the period 1993{\textendash}2005. The authors relate their movements to the two main atmospheric climate modes of the Southern Hemisphere: the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) and the El Ni{\~n}o{\textendash}Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The study finds that although the fronts are steered by the bathymetry, which sets their mean pathway on first order, in flat-bottom areas the fronts are subject to large meandering because of mesoscale activity and atmospheric forcing. While the dominant mode of atmospheric variability in the Southern Hemisphere, SAM, is relatively symmetric, the oceanic response of the fronts is not, showing substantial regional differences. Around the circumpolar belt the fronts vary in latitude, exposing them to different Ekman transport anomalies induced by the SAM. Three typical scenarios occur in response to atmospheric forcing: poleward movement of the frontal structure in the Indian Basin during positive SAM events, an equatorward movement in the central Pacific, and an intensification without substantial meridional movement in the Indo-Pacific basin. The study also shows the geographical regions that are dominated by a SAM or ENSO response at low and high frequencies.},

Idealized quasigeostrophic turbulence models suggest mesoscale turbulent flow can vary between isotropic, and highly anisotropic zonal jets. Here we compare the zonal and meridional velocity variance from satellite altimetry. We find that, for an unexplained reason and despite the chaotic nature of turbulence, the surface flow is organized into mesoscale patches where either zonal or meridional velocity variance dominates. The patches persist over 13 years, much longer than the turbulent timescale of a few months. Implications include potentially highly anisotropic redistribution of tracers by the mesoscale flow. Zonally averaged velocity variances reveal a slight preference for meridional over zonal velocity variance. Realistic primitive equation models succeed in reproducing both the patchy structure in local preference for either zonal or meridional velocity variance, and the zonally averaged preference for meridional variance. Idealized models of fully developed, quasigeostrophic turbulence fail in both regards.},

  abstract = {A mechanism for the generation of intrathermocline eddies (ITEs) at wind-forced fronts is examined using a high resolution numerical simulation. Favorable conditions for ITE formation result at fronts forced by ``down-front'' winds, i.e. winds blowing in the direction of the frontal jet. Down-front winds exert frictional forces that reduce the potential vorticity (PV) within the surface boundary in the frontal outcrop, providing a source for the low-PV water that is the materia prima of ITEs. Meandering of the front drives vertical motions that subduct the low-PV water into the pycnocline, pooling it into the coherent anticyclonic vortex of a submesoscale ITE. As the fluid is subducted along the outcropping frontal isopycnal, the low-PV water, which at the surface is associated with strongly baroclinic flow, re-expresses itself as water with nearly zero absolute vorticity. This generation of strong anticyclonic vorticity results from the tilting of the horizontal vorticity of the frontal jet, not from vortex squashing. During the formation of the ITE, high-PV water from the pycnocline is upwelled alongside the subducting low-PV surface water. The positive correlation between the ITE's velocity and PV fields results in an upward, along-isopycnal eddy PV flux that scales with the surface frictional PV flux driven by the wind. The relationship between the eddy and wind-induced frictional PV flux is nonlocal in time, as the eddy PV flux persists long after the wind forcing is shut off. The ITE's PV flux affects the large-scale flow by driving an eddy-induced transport or bolus velocity down the outcropping isopycnal layer with a magnitude that scales with the Ekman velocity.},

  abstract = {Increased spatial resolution in recent observations and modeling has revealed a richness of structure and processes on lateral scales of a kilometer in the upper ocean. Processes at this scale, termed submesoscale, are distinguished by order one Rossby and Richardson numbers; their dynamics are distinct from those of the largely quasi-geostrophic mesoscale, as well as fully three-dimensional, small-scale, processes. Submesoscale processes make an important contribution to the vertical flux of mass, buoyancy, and tracers in the upper ocean. They flux potential vorticity through the mixed layer, enhance communication between the pycnocline and surface, and play a crucial role in changing the upper-ocean stratification and mixed-layer structure on a time scale of days. In this review, we present a synthesis of upper-ocean submesoscale processes, arising in the presence of lateral buoyancy gradients. We describe their generation through frontogenesis, unforced instabilities, and forced motions due to buoyancy loss or down-front winds. Using the semi-geostrophic (SG) framework, we present physical arguments to help interpret several key aspects of submesoscale flows. These include the development of narrow elongated regions with O(1) Rossby and Richardson numbers through frontogenesis, intense vertical velocities with a downward bias at these sites, and secondary circulations that redistribute buoyancy to stratify the mixed layer. We review some of the first parameterizations for submesoscale processes that attempt to capture their contribution to, firstly, vertical buoyancy fluxes and restratification by mixed layer instabilities and, secondly, the exchange of potential vorticity between the wind- and buoyancyforced surface, mixed layer, and pycnocline. Submesoscale processes are emerging as vital for the transport of biogeochemical properties, for generating spatial heterogeneity that is critical for biogeochemical processes and mixing, and for the transfer of energy from the meso to small scales. Several studies are in progress to model, measure, analyze, understand, and parameterize these motions.},

  abstract = {Ocean color and sea surface temperature data from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard the Terra satellite are used to study the cross-shelf circulation and transport of suspended sediments in the Yellow and the East China Seas. The ocean color images show a significant turbid water plume extending in the southeast direction from the Subei coasts of China to the shelf edge south of Cheju during fall{\textendash}winter, suggesting significant cross-shelf currents in the Yellow Sea/East China Sea in winter. The currents transport suspended sediments from the area of the old Huanghe mouth into the Okinawa Trough. Part of the turbid plume joins the Yellow Sea Warm Current to enter the Yellow Sea trough in winter. The satellite images suggest that the time scales of cross-shelf transport and surface-to-subsurface descending of the suspended sediments are a few weeks. The turbid plume grows in fall, reaches its maximum expansion and intensity in winter{\textendash}spring, and subsides in late spring. In summer, the plume becomes coastally trapped. Substantial interannual variations of the intensity and coverage of the turbid plume are indicated by the observations. In comparison, the Changjiang Diluted Water in summer only transports a small amount of the Changjiang suspended sediment to the outer shelf south of Cheju, which does not enter the Yellow Sea owing to the weak intrusion of the Yellow Sea Warm Current in summer. The dynamics of the cross-shelf circulation in the Yellow Sea in winter are hypothesized to be associated with (1) the convergence of the Yellow Sea Coastal Current and the Taiwan Warm Current off the Changjiang mouth and (2) the time-dependent forcing of the northerly wind bursts that drives the intrusion of the Yellow Sea Warm Current.},

Based on the analysis of more than 4000 long-lived eddy trajectories in every EBUS, we show that mesoscale structures are mainly generated along the continental coasts and south of the main archipelagos and propagate westward with velocities increasing toward the equator. These mesoscale eddies, having radii of 70{\textendash}160 km, are then frequently observed along the coastal transition zones and frontal regions and some large oceanic areas are preferentially populated by cyclonic or anticyclonic eddies. Temporal variations of the number of newly-formed eddies and the associated eddy activity index, defined as the mean eddy energy density, are finally examined at seasonal and interannual scales. The strongest seasonal (interannual, respectively) variations are observed in the California (Benguela) upwelling systems. The proposed indices also exhibit contrasted long-term trends in each EBUS, which suggests that eddy activity might be sensitive to a warming climate.},

  abstract = {Satellite altimeter data are used to study the characteristics of the horizontal propagation of eddy variability of the global oceans. Decade-long time series of sea surface height is analyzed for finding the maximum cross correlation with neighboring time series within a window of space and time lags. The space and time lags corresponding to the maximum correlation allow an estimate of the propagation velocity of the eddy variability that dominates the variance of sea surface height anomalies. The method cannot distinguish the various forms of eddy variability: isolated eddies and fronts, the meandering of ocean currents, or planetary waves. However, the results provide, at a given location of the global oceans, a uniquely determined propagation velocity that represents a time-averaged description of the tendency of the movement of the local eddy variability. The propagation velocity is highly inhomogeneous in space. Outside the equatorial zone, the zonal propagation is intrinsically westward, modified by ocean currents, which could reverse the zonal propagation to eastward in regions like the Gulf Stream and the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. At midlatitudes and high latitudes, the propagation pattern is highly affected by the path of ocean currents and the shape of bottom topography. At tropical latitudes, the meridional propagation is convergent toward the equator in the western basins and divergent away from the equator in the eastern basins. Comparison with the simulations of an eddy-permitting ocean general circulation model shows overall agreement, especially in the latitudinal variation of the zonal propagation velocity. The result suggests that the model has captured the essence of the dynamics governing the propagation of ocean eddy variability.},

  abstract = {Observations of topographic Rossby waves (TRW), using moored current meters, bottom pressure gauges, and Lagrangian RAFOS floats, are investigated for the deep basin of the Gulf of Mexico. Recent extensive measurement programs in many parts of the deep gulf, which were inspired by oil and gas industry explorations into ever deeper water, allow more comprehensive analyses of the propagation and dissipation of these deep planetary waves. The Gulf of Mexico circulation can be divided into two layers with the \$800{\textendash}1200 m upper layer being dominated by the Loop Current (LC) pulsations and shedding of large (diameters \$300{\textendash}400 km) anticyclonic eddies in the east, and the translation of these LC eddies across the basin to the west. These processes spawn smaller eddies of both signs through instabilities, and interactions with topography and other eddies to produce energetic surface layer flows that have a rich spectrum of orbit periods and diameters. In contrast, current variability below 1000 m often has the characteristics of TRWs, with periods ranging from \$10{\textendash}100 days and wavelengths of \$50{\textendash}200 km, showing almost depthindependent or slightly bottom intensified currents through the weakly stratified lower water column. These fluctuations are largely uncorrelated with simultaneous upper-layer eddy flows. TRWs must be generated through energy transfer from the upper-layer eddies to the lower layer by potential vorticity adjustments to changing depths of the bottom and the interface between the layers. Therefore, the LC and LC eddies are prime candidates as has been suggested by some model studies. Model simulations have also indicated that deep lower-layer eddies may be generated by the LC and LC eddy shedding processes.},

It then analyzes the patterns in the suite to select a final MLD estimate. The new algorithm is provided in online supplemental materials. Developed using profiles from all oceans, the algorithm is compared to threshold methods that use the C. de Boyer Monte{\textasciiacute} gut et al. criteria and to gradient methods using 13 601 Argo profiles from the southeast Pacific and southwest Atlantic Oceans. In general, the threshold methods find deeper MLDs than the new algorithm and the gradient methods produce more anomalous MLDs than the new algorithm. When constrained to using only temperature profiles, the algorithm offers a clear improvement over the temperature threshold and gradient methods; the new temperature algorithm MLDs more closely approximate the density algorithm MLDs than the temperature threshold and gradient MLDs. The algorithm is applied to profiles from a formation region of Subantarctic Mode Water (SAMW) and Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW). The density algorithm finds that the deepest MLDs in this region routinely reach 500 dbar and occur north of the A. H. Orsi et al. mean Subantarctic Front in the southeastern Pacific Ocean. The deepest MLDs typically occur in August and September and are congruent with the subsurface salinity minimum, a signature of AAIW.},

  abstract = {Fine horizontal-scale surveys performed during the Kuroshio Extension System Study in May 2004 provide near-synoptic ADCP and CTD data along cross-jet transects just upstream of the first meander trough of the Kuroshio Extension. An array of current- and pressure-recording inverted echo sounders (CPIES) deployed over a \$600 {\^A} 600 km region centered on the first meander trough provide time series of bottom pressure and currents as well as acoustic travel time (t), which is converted via the gravest empirical mode method to profiles of temperature, salinity, and specific volume anomaly. These datasets are used here to determine the mean velocity, hydrographic, and potential vorticity structure of the Kuroshio Extension in its ``weakly meandering'' state in a stream-coordinate system, which avoids the lateral smearing of the jet structure that results from an Eulerian approach. Maximum surface down-stream velocities range from 1 to 2 m/s, averaging around 1.4 m/s. Down-stream velocities reach the bottom south of the core with average magnitudes of 1{\textendash}5 cm/s but vary in magnitude and direction depending upon the presence of deep barotropic eddies. In the first meander crest, mean cross-stream flux (O(0.5{\textendash}2 cm/s)) is towards the cyclonic side, while entering the trough it is towards the anticyclonic side. However, cross-stream flows appear to be event-driven, with fluctuations in steepness of the meander pattern driven by jet instability. Transports above 5300 dbar decrease west to east from 138 Sv at 143:75 E in the first crest, to 124 Sv at the trough and 75 Sv entering the second crest at 148:5 E. The mean from the surveys shows relative vorticity (z) making contributions as high as 72\% of f on the cyclonic side and {\`A}41\% of f on the anticyclonic side, while the ``twisting'' term due to vertical shear and horizontal density gradients reaches a maximum in the mean of 45\% of f north of the core. Comparison of the structure in crests and troughs from the CPIES dataset reveals differences in the distribution of relative vorticity across the core. Both datasets suggest the presence of four isopycnal potential vorticity gradient layers, where strong cross-stream gradients in shallower layers represent a barrier to cross-stream flow. Comparison of the Kuroshio Extension to the Gulf Stream suggests that mean velocities and gradients are generally about 30\% weaker in the Kuroshio Extension, and the strong jet structure penetrates to about 25\% greater depths in the Gulf Stream.},

The position and strength of the recirculation gyres simulated by a highresolution numerical model are found to be consistent with the observations. The circulation pattern that is revealed is of a complex system of multiple recirculation gyres that are embedded in the crests and troughs of the quasi-permanent meanders of the Kuroshio Extension. At the location of the KESS array, the Kuroshio Extension jet and its recirculation gyres transport of about 114 Sv. This represents a 2.7-fold increase in the transport of the current compared to the Kuroshio's transport at Cape Ashizuri before it separates from the coast and flows eastward into the open ocean. This enhancement in the current's transport comes from the development of the flanking recirculation gyres. Estimates from an array of inverted echo sounders and a high-resolution ocean general circulation model are of similar magnitude.},

The second one synthesizes near-surface velocities from a network of ocean drifters, hydrographic profiles, and ocean winds sorted according to the horizontal scales. In the third method, these global datasets are used in the context of the ocean surface momentum balance. The second and third methods are used to improve accuracy of the dynamic topography on fine space scales poorly resolved in the first method. When they are used to compute a multiyear time-mean global ocean surface circulation on a 0.58 horizontal resolution, both contain very similar, new small-scale midocean current patterns. In particular, extensions of western boundary currents appear narrow and strong despite temporal variability and exhibit persistent meanders and multiple branching. Also, the locations of the velocity concentrations in the Antarctic Circumpolar Current become well defined. Ageostrophic velocities reveal convergent zones in each subtropical basin. These maps present a new context in which to view the continued ocean monitoring with in situ instruments and satellites.},

The fluctuations grow by a combination of baroclinic and barotropic energy conversions from the 2D frontal flow, with the former dominating for most of the situations examined, ranging from small to O(1) values of the Rossby and Froude numbers and nondimensional deformation rate. Averaged 3D fluctuation buoyancy fluxes resist the 2D frontogenesis by a frontolytic tendency. They also augment the buoyancy restratification and potential-to-kinetic energy conversion tendencies of the 2D frontogenesis itself, and the 2D frontogenetic and 3D eddy-induced secondary circulations are mostly reinforcing (unlike in turbulent baroclinic jets). This shows that frontal instability coexists with, and potentially may even overcome, active frontogenesis; this conclusion is contrary to some previous studies. Frontal instability thus can augment frontogenesis in accomplishing a forward cascade of energy from oceanic mesoscale eddies into the submesoscale regime en route to finescale dissipation.},

  abstract = {Large-amplitude sea surface height (SSH) variations with a wave period of 70 days and a wavelength of about 700 km are detected in the Coral Sea centered along ;168S and in the North Fiji Basin along ;188S. These mesoscale eddy signals have a well-defined annual cycle with a maximum in December/January and a minimum in May/June. As the southeasterly trades intercept the island mountains of Vanuatu and Fiji, they generate localized wind stress curl dipoles, which in turn induce the eastward-flowing Coral Sea Countercurrent (CSCC) and Fiji Basin Countercurrent (FBCC) in the Coral Sea and the North Fiji Basin, respectively. The high eddy variability band along 168S is hypothesized in this study as resulting from barotropic instability due to the lateral shear between the eastward-flowing CSCC and its neighboring westward-flowing North Caledonian and North Vanuatu jets (NCJ and NVJ). Based on stability analyses on the background NCJ{\textendash}CSCC{\textendash}NVJ system, it is found that the most unstable mode of the system has an equivalent barotropic structure and is insensitive to the specification of the background flow's vertical shear. This barotropic instability hypothesis is also supported by observations; specifically, the Reynolds stresses inferred from the observed SSH data are tilted against the meridional shear of the background NCJ{\textendash}CSCC{\textendash}NVJ flow. As the intensity of the NCJ{\textendash}CSCC{\textendash}NVJ shear fluctuates with the season, the growth rate of instability changes, resulting in seasonal amplitude modulations in the observed 70-day eddy signals.},

  abstract = {We report, from remote sensing and in situ observations, a new type of permanent structure in the eastern subtropical Atlantic Ocean, that we call the ``Canary Eddy Corridor''. The phenomenon, is a zonal long-lived ({$>$}3 months) mesoscale eddy corridor, whose source is the flow perturbation of the Canary Current and the Trade Winds at the Canary Islands. The latitudinal range of the corridor spans 22{\textdegree}N{\textendash}29{\textdegree}N and extends from the Canaries to at least 32{\textordmasculine}W, near the mid-Atlantic. This is the main region of long-lived westward-propagating eddies in the subtropical northeast Atlantic. From a age-distribution study we observe that at least 10\% of mesoscale eddies in this region are long-lived, with a dominance of anticyclones over cyclones. Another four westward-propagating eddy corridors were also detected: two small corridors north and south of the Azores Front; a small zonal corridor located near 31{\textordmasculine}N, south of the island of Madeira; and a small corridor located near the Cape Blanc giant filament. The existence of these corridors may change, at least for the northeastern subtropical Atlantic, the general idea that mesoscale eddies are disorganized, ubiquitous structures in the ocean. The Canary Eddy Corridor constitutes a direct zonal pathway that conveys water mass- and biogeochemical properties offshore from the Canary Island/Northwest Africa upwelling system, and may be seen as a recurrent offshore pump of organic matter and carbon to the oligotrophic ocean interior. Estimates of volume and mass transport indicate that Canary Eddy Corridor westward transport is more than one-fourth of the southward transport of the Canary Current. The westward transport of kinetic energy by the eddies of the Canary Corridor is as important as the southward transport by the Canary Current. The total primary production related to the Corridor may be as high as the total primary production of the northwest Africa upwelling system for the same latitude range.},

The comparison reveals the locally enhanced meridional gradient of turbulent fluxes of heat and moisture and surface air temperature (SAT) across the oceanic frontal zone, which favors the storm-track development both in winter and spring.

An atmospheric sounding campaign was conducted on board the R/V Roger Revelle during the 2005 summer. Transects of soundings across the KE front are analyzed to study its effects on the atmosphere, along with continuous surface meteorological and ceilometer cloud-base observations. While the KE front remained nearly stationary during the cruise, the baiu front displayed large meridional displacements that changed wind direction across the KE front. The presence of sharp sea surface temperature (SST) gradients anchored by the KE enhanced the thermal and moisture advection, causing substantial changes in the marine atmospheric boundary layer (MABL) structure. When the baiu front was displaced north of the KE front, southwesterly winds advected warm, humid air from the subtropics over the cold water, producing a surface inversion favorable to fog formation. When the baiu front was to the south, on the other hand, northerly winds across the KE front destabilized the MABL, leading to the formation of a solid low-cloud deck beneath a strong capping inversion. The wind changes with the meridional displacement of the baiu front thus caused large variations in near-surface atmospheric stability and surface turbulent heat fluxes, with potential feedback on deep convection and fog/low-cloud formation around the front.},

The results show that the eddy pair is a seasonal phenomenon usually found in the summer to fall. It can reach downward to about 400 m depth but is strongest at the upper 100 m depth. In addition, the eddy pair displays a remarkable interannual variability with periods of 5.6 and 3.6 years. The local wind stress curl plays an important role in the interannual variability of eddy pair. Moreover, the eddy pair has an obvious impact on the thermohaline structure of the local upper ocean. The eddy pair can lead to stronger temperature variability in the upper 380 m but stronger salinity variability only in the upper 150 m depth. When the eddy pair is strong, the anticyclonic eddy deepens the thermocline, while the cyclonic eddy shoals the thermocline. Taking the depth of 20 1C isotherm as the thermocline depth, we find that in September, the thermocline drops downward to 110{\textendash}140 m depth in the anti-cyclonic eddy but rises up to 50{\textendash}80 m depth in the cyclonic eddy.},

  abstract = {The Kuroshio Extension System Study (KESS) aimed to quantify processes governing the variability of and the interaction between the Kuroshio Extension and the recirculation gyre. To meet this goal, a suite of instrumentation, including 43 inverted echo sounders equipped with bottom pressure gauges and current meters [current and pressure recording inverted echo sounders (CPIES)], was deployed. The array was centered on the first quasi-stationary meander crest and trough east of Japan, which is also the region of highest eddy kinetic energy. KESS was the first experiment to deploy a large quantity of these new CPIES instruments, and it was unique in that the instruments were deployed in water depths (5300{\textendash}6400 m) close to their limit of operation. A comprehensive narrative of the methodology to produce mesoscale-resolving fourdimensional circulation fields of temperature, specific volume anomaly, and velocity from the KESS CPIES array is provided. In addition, an improved technique for removing pressure drift is introduced. Methodology and error estimates were verified with several independent datasets. Temperature error was lowest on the equatorward side of the Kuroshio Extension core and decreased with depth (1.58C at 300 m, 0.38C at 600 m, and ,0.18C below 1200 m). Velocity errors were highest in regions of strong eddy kinetic energy, within and south of the jet core. Near the surface, the error in geostrophic velocity between adjacent CPIES was typically 10 cm s21, decreasing downward to 6 cm s21 at 500-m depth and 5 cm s21 below 800 m. The rms differences from pointwise current measurements are nearly twice as large as the geostrophic errors, because the pointwise velocities include submesoscale and ageostrophic contributions.},

Little supporting evidence is available to partition the spectra among forced motions and turbulent cascades, along with significant energy more consistent with weakly non-linear wave dynamics. Linear-response wind-forced motions appear to dominate the high frequency (but subinertial) mooring frequency spectra. Turbulent cascades appear to fill the high wavenumber spectra in altimetric data and numerical simulations. Progress on these issues is hindered by the difficulty in connecting the comparatively easily available frequency spectra with the variety of theoretically predicted wavenumber spectra.},

The objective methods are (1) maximum slope by difference, (2) maximum slope by regression, (3) four-segment profile model, (4) inflection point, and (5) variable representative isotherm. Mixed layer depth is well estimated by the temperature criterion of (SST-0.8{\textdegree}C) independent of the estimation of thermocline parameters. Thermocline depth and strength are well estimated by the variable representative isotherm method. However, thermocline strength measured as the slope of the temperature-depth profile does not provide a good measure of stratification of the water column.

This study investigates the distribution of the sea surface height anomaly (SSHA) with the aim of quantifying the characteristics of mesoscale eddies in the Kuroshio{\textendash}Oyashio extension region (KOER), where intense mesoscale eddies are commonly observed during hydrographic surveys. Dense distributions of both anticyclonic eddies (AEs) and cyclonic eddies (CEs) are detected for the first time in KOER with sufficient temporal and spatial coverage, using the Okubo{\textendash}Weiss parameter without smoothing. Their contribution to the total SSHA variance is estimated to be about 50\%. The zones of highest amplitudes are located north and south of the axis of the Kuroshio Extension (KE) for AEs and CEs, which represent warm-core and cold-core rings, respectively; the areas extend poleward along the Japan and Kuril{\textendash}Kamchatka Trenches, especially for AEs. Eddies of both polarities and with moderate amplitudes are also recognized along the Subarctic Front (SAF). Eddies in areas north and south of the KE generally propagate westward, at a mean rate of 1{\textendash}5 cm s21; those along the trenches south of 468N and along the SAF propagate poleward at mean rates of 1{\textendash}2 and 0.5{\textendash}1 cm s21, respectively. Because of the asymmetric distribution of the AEs and CEs in the areas north and south of the KE, and the asymmetric amplitude of them along the Japan and Kuril{\textendash}Kamchatka Trenches, there exist significant eddy fluxes of vorticity, heat, and salinity in these areas.},

  abstract = {Vertical profile data of temperature and salinity from various sources were analyzed together with satellite altimeter data to investigate the water mass characteristics of warm and cold anticyclonic eddies in the western boundary region of the subarctic North Pacific. A dense distribution of anticyclonic eddies with warm and saline core water occurred near the Kuroshio Extension, and the distribution extends northward{\textendash}northeastward into the western subarctic gyre along the Japan and Kuril{\textendash}Kamchatka trenches. Eddies with cold and fresh core water are found mainly around the Oyashio southward intrusions and farther north near the Kuril Islands. Based on the heat content anomaly integrated over 50{\textendash}200 dbar, 85\% of the anticyclonic eddies within the study area (358{\textendash}508N, 1408{\textendash}1558E) have a warm and saline core and 15\% have a cold and fresh core. Warm and saline eddies around the Japan and Kuril{\textendash}Kamchatka trenches have a double-core structure, with a cold and freshwater mass located below the warm core. The northward propagation of these eddies along the trench line results in a large northward heat (salinity) transport in the upper 400 dbar (250 dbar) and a negative salinity transport below 350 dbar. The lower core water is colder and fresher on isopycnal surfaces at around 26.70su compared with the climatology. Given that the 26.70su isopycnal surface does not outcrop in the open North Pacific, an alignment process is suggested to occur between the warm and saline and the cold and fresh anticyclonic eddies in the upper and intermediate layers, respectively.},

  abstract = {Argo float profile data are used to analyze warm, salty, weakly stratified, subthermocline eddies of tropical origin in the eastern subtropical South Pacific Ocean. These eddies contain anomalous signatures of the equatorial Pacific ``138C Water'' that is carried poleward within the Peru{\textendash}Chile Undercurrent (PCU) as it flows along the west coast of South America. From their source along the Chilean coast between ;298 and 398S, the eddies spread westward and slightly northward, likely at least partly advected by the subtropical gyre. The eddy water properties contrast strongly with the colder, fresher, more strongly stratified waters of subantarctic origin being carried northward then westward by the gyre. Near the eddy source, about 6\% of Argo profiles sample eddies that are above selected thresholds for both salinity and potential vorticity anomalies relative to maps of the mean distributions of these properties on and around the core isopycnal for the eddies. The proportion of such profiles diminishes to about 1\% near the northwestern limit of the eddy range, near 158S and 1158W. These eddies are anticyclonic, with a subsurface radial velocity maximum near the core isopycnal for water property anomalies, hence a reduced surface expression. Their geostrophic signature sometimes extends below 1000 dbar, suggesting the eddies may influence float subsurface trajectories. Radial transports around the eddy centers are estimated to be on the order of 2 3 106 m3 s21 for the potential density layer 26.0 , su , 27.0 kg m23, about the same magnitude as the mean poleward transport of the PCU.},

Their potential contribution to the climate system motivated major parallel field programs in both the North Pacific [Kuroshio Extension System Study (KESS)] and the North Atlantic [Climate Variability and Predictability (CLIVAR) Mode Water Dynamics Experiment (CLIMODE)], and preliminary observations and analyses from these programs highlight that complexity. The Gulf Stream (GS) in the North Atlantic and the Kuroshio Extension (KE) in the North Pacific have broad similarities, as subtropical gyre WBCs, but they also have significant differences, which affect the regional air{\textendash}sea exchange processes and their larger-scale interactions. The 15-yr satellite altimeter data record, which provides a rich source of information, is combined here with the longer historical record from in situ data to describe and compare the current systems. While many important similarities have been noted on the dynamic and thermodynamic aspects of the time-varying GS and KE, some notso-subtle differences exist in current variability, mode water properties, and recirculation gyre structure. This paper provides a comprehensive comparison of these two current systems from both dynamical and thermodynamical perspectives with the goal of developing and evaluating hypotheses about the physics underlying the observed differences, and exploring the WBC's potential to influence midlatitude sea{\textendash}air interaction. Differences between the GS and KE systems offer opportunities to compare the dominant processes and thereby to advance understanding of their role in the climate system.},

  abstract = {Ocean{\textendash}atmosphere interaction over the Northern Hemisphere western boundary current (WBC) regions (i.e., the Gulf Stream, Kuroshio, Oyashio, and their extensions) is reviewed with an emphasis on their role in basin-scale climate variability. SST anomalies exhibit considerable variance on interannual to decadal time scales in these regions. Low-frequency SST variability is primarily driven by basin-scale wind stress curl variability via the oceanic Rossby wave adjustment of the gyre-scale circulation that modulates the latitude and strength of the WBC-related oceanic fronts. Rectification of the variability by mesoscale eddies, reemergence of the anomalies from the preceding winter, and tropical remote forcing also play important roles in driving and maintaining the low-frequency variability in these regions. In the Gulf Stream region, interaction with the deep western boundary current also likely influences the low-frequency variability. Surface heat fluxes damp the low-frequency SST anomalies over the WBC regions; thus, heat fluxes originate with heat anomalies in the ocean and have the potential to drive the overlying atmospheric circulation. While recent observational studies demonstrate a local atmospheric boundary layer response to WBC changes, the latter's influence on the large-scale atmospheric circulation is still unclear. Nevertheless, heat and moisture fluxes from the WBCs into the atmosphere influence the mean state of the atmospheric circulation, including anchoring the latitude of the storm tracks to the WBCs. Furthermore, many climate models suggest that the large-scale atmospheric response to SST anomalies driven by ocean dynamics in WBC regions can be important in generating decadal climate variability. As a step toward bridging climate model results and observations, the degree of realism of the WBC in current climate model simulations is assessed. Finally, outstanding issues concerning ocean{\textendash}atmosphere interaction in WBC regions and its impact on climate variability are discussed.},

Archiving, validation, and interpretation of satellite oceanographic altimetry data and ocean general circulation model for the Earth Simulator results indicate that the variation propagates clockwise from Japan's east coast through the Tsushima Strait into the Japan/ East Sea (JES) and then northward along the west coast. In this study, we hypothesize and test numerically that the sealevel variability along the west coast of Japan is remotely forced by the Kuroshio Extension (KE) off the east coast. Topographic Rossby waves and boundary Kelvin waves facilitate the connection. Our 3D Princeton Ocean Model when forced by observed wind stress reproduces well the seasonal changes in the vicinity of JES. Two additional experiments were conducted to examine the relative roles of remote forcing and local forcing. The sea-level variability inside the JES was dramatically reduced when the Tsushima Strait is blocked in one experiment. The removal of the local forcing, in another experiment, has little effect on the JES variability. Both experiments support our hypothesis that the open-ocean forcing, possibly through the KE variability, is the leading forcing mechanism for sea-level change along the west coast of Japan.},

Existing methods are either based on the distribution of physical parameters usually computed from velocity derivatives or on the geometry of velocity streamlines around minima or maxima of sea level anomaly. A new algorithm was developed based exclusively on the geometry of the velocity vectors. Four constraints characterizing the spatial distribution of the velocity vectors around eddy centers were derived from the general features associated with velocity fields in the presence of eddies. The grid points in the domain for which these four constraints are satisfied are detected as eddy centers. Eddy sizes are computed from closed contours of the streamfunction field, and eddy tracks are retrieved by comparing the distribution of eddy centers at successive time steps. The results were validated against manually derived eddy fields. Two parameters in the algorithm can be modified by the users to optimize its performance. The algorithm is applied to both a high-resolution model product and highfrequency radar surface velocity fields in the Southern California Bight.},

STCC-NEC 年际变化的垂直切变的原因可以在 STCC 带内表面埃克曼温度梯度收敛的强迫中寻找。与之前假设的厄尔尼诺 o-南方涛动信号不同，埃克曼强迫场的年际变化以及 STCC-NEC 的垂直切变与负西太平洋指数信号更相关。 Interannual changes in the mesoscale eddy field along the Subtropical Countercurrent (STCC) band of 188{\textendash}258N in the western North Pacific Ocean are investigated with 16 yr of satellite altimeter data. Enhanced eddy activities were observed in 1996{\textendash}98 and 2003{\textendash}08, whereas the eddy activities were below average in 1993{\textendash}95 and 1999{\textendash}2002. Analysis of repeat hydrographic data along 1378E reveals that the vertical shear between the surface eastward-flowing STCC and the subsurface westward-flowing North Equatorial Current (NEC) was larger in the eddy-rich years than in the eddy-weak years. By adopting a 2{$\frac{1}{2}$}-layer reduced-gravity model, it is shown that the increased eddy kinetic energy level in 1996{\textendash}98 and 2003{\textendash}08 is because of enhanced baroclinic instability resulting from the larger vertical shear in the STCC{\textendash}NEC's background flow. The cause for the STCC{\textendash}NEC's interannually varying vertical shear can be sought in the forcing by surface Ekman temperature gradient convergence within the STCC band. Rather than El Nin{\texttildelow} o{\textendash}Southern Oscillation signals as previously hypothesized, interannual changes in this Ekman forcing field, and hence the STCC{\textendash}NEC's vertical shear, are more related to the negative western Pacific index signals.},

During the stable state of 10/1992{\textendash}06/1995 and 01/2002{\textendash}12/2004, the KE jet was intense and had a northerly zonal mean path and a well-defined southern recirculation gyre. During the unstable state of 07/1995{\textendash}12/2001 and 01/2005{\textendash}present, the KE jet had a reduced eastward transport and a more southerly flow path. Transitions between the two dynamic states are caused by the basinscale wind-stress curl forcing in the eastern North Pacific related to the Pacific decadal oscillations (PDOs) or the North Pacific Gyre Oscillations (NPGOs). During the positive PDO (or negative NPGO) phase, the intensified Aleutian Low generates negative SSH anomalies in the eastern North Pacific through Ekman divergence. As these wind-induced negative SSH anomalies propagate to the west as baroclinic Rossby waves, they weaken the zonal KE jet and shift its path southward. As its path is pushed southward {\dh} \$ 323N{\TH}, the deep-reaching KE jet has to ride over the shallow Shatsky Rise, generating localized disturbances that lead to their subsequent development along the KE jet west of the Shatsky Rise. The sequence opposite to that listed above occurs when the PDO (NPGO) changes to its negative (positive) phase. After the KE system transitions from a stable to unstable state, the enhanced eddy interaction is found to strengthen both the southern recirculation gyre and quasi-stationary meanders along the KE's upstream path. This nonlinear eddy interaction is important in determining the amplitude of the observed decadal KE variability.},

  abstract = {Panulirus japonicus is an important target for fisheries in Japan. Characteristics of long distance larval transport and recruitment of P. japonicus have been revealed based on drifter studies and larval sampling. Larval recruitment of the lobster is completed within the Kuroshio Subgyre circulation, i.e., early stage phyllosomas that are released in Japanese coastal waters in summer (July-September) are transported into the Kuroshio region; larvae are then transported to the Kuroshio Counter-Current region south of the Kuroshio; these larvae are then transported into the waters east of the Ryukyu Archipelago where subfinal/final-stage phyllosomas and pueruli enter the Kuroshio again and are transported to different locations of Japanese coastal waters through the Kuroshio in the summer of the following year. Using mtDNA sequences for the COI region of P. japonicus juveniles and adults, no significant population subdivision was detected among distant locations. There was no characteristic geographical distribution pattern for haplotypes, supporting the hypothesis that these benthic individuals are sustained by a common pool of phyllosomas through long distance larval transport by phyllosomas within the Kuroshio Subgyre circulation. This scenario is also supported by the examination of longterm variation in P. japonicus catches as follows. Two clusters (A, B) of regions located east (A) and west (B) of the cape Shionomisaki at the southern tip of the Kii Peninsula were identified. There was a significant positive relationship between the Kuroshio index and the catch index two years later for cluster A. This relationship suggests that annual variation in P. japonicus catch may be determined by the variation in puerulus recruitment through the Kuroshio. Relationships between these two clusters varied depending on three periods, which corresponded to the three climate regimes (i.e., years before 1976, from 1977 to 1988, and after 1989). Significant negative relationships were detected between the catch index of these two clusters from 1975 to 2001.},

  abstract = {In this study, the influence of a geostrophically balanced horizontal density gradient on turbulent convection in the ocean is examined using numerical simulations and a theoretical scaling analysis. Starting with uniform horizontal and vertical buoyancy gradients, convection is driven by imposing a heat loss or a destabilizing wind stress at the upper boundary, and a turbulent layer soon develops. For weak lateral fronts, turbulent convection results in a nearly homogeneous mixed layer (ML) whose depth grows in time. For strong fronts, a turbulent layer develops, but this layer is not an ML in the traditional sense because it is characterized by persistent horizontal and vertical gradients in density. The turbulent layer is, however, nearly homogeneous in potential vorticity (PV), with a value near zero. Using the PV budget, a scaling for the depth of the turbulent low PV layer and its time dependence is derived that compares well with numerical simulations. Two dynamical regimes are identified. In a convective layer near the surface, turbulence is generated by the buoyancy loss at the surface; below this layer, turbulence is generated by a symmetric instability of the lateral density gradient. This work extends classical scalings for the depth of turbulent boundary layers to account for the ubiquitous presence of lateral density gradients in the ocean. The new results indicate that a lateral density gradient, in addition to the surface forcing, can affect the stratification and the rate of growth of the surface boundary layer.},

  abstract = {Understanding the processes responsible for coastal change is important for managing our coastal resources, both natural and economic. The current scientific understanding of coastal sediment transport and geology suggests that examining coastal processes at regional scales can lead to significant insight into how the coastal zone evolves. To better identify the significant processes affecting our coastlines and how those processes create coastal change we developed a Coupled Ocean{\textendash}Atmosphere{\textendash}Wave{\textendash}Sediment Transport (COAWST) Modeling System, which is comprised of the Model Coupling Toolkit to exchange data fields between the ocean model ROMS, the atmosphere model WRF, the wave model SWAN, and the sediment capabilities of the Community Sediment Transport Model. This formulation builds upon previous developments by coupling the atmospheric model to the ocean and wave models, providing one-way grid refinement in the ocean model, one-way grid refinement in the wave model, and coupling on refined levels. Herein we describe the modeling components and the data fields exchanged. The modeling system is used to identify model sensitivity by exchanging prognostic variable fields between different model components during an application to simulate Hurricane Isabel during September 2003. Results identify that hurricane intensity is extremely sensitive to sea surface temperature. Intensity is reduced when coupled to the ocean model although the coupling provides a more realistic simulation of the sea surface temperature. Coupling of the ocean to the atmosphere also results in decreased boundary layer stress and coupling of the waves to the atmosphere results in increased bottom stress. Wave results are sensitive to both ocean and atmospheric coupling due to wave{\textendash}current interactions with the ocean and wave growth from the atmosphere wind stress. Sediment resuspension at regional scale during the hurricane is controlled by shelf width and wave propagation during hurricane approach.},

In particular, the spatial and temporal variation of the effective depth of EHT He was investigated, which is defined by the depth integrated EHT (D-EHT) divided by EHT at the surface. It was found that the annual mean value of He is proportional to the eddy kinetic energy (EKE) level at the surface in general. However, its seasonal variation is controlled by the mixed layer depth (MLD) in the extratropical ocean (.208N). Examination of the simulated eddy structures reveals that the temperature associated with mesoscale eddies is radically modified by the surface forcing in the mixed layer, while the velocity field is not, and the consequent enhanced misalignment of temperature and velocity anomalies leads to the radical change of EHT across the seasonal thermocline.},

  abstract = {A general ocean circulation model is used to study the dynamics of the cross-shelf circulation in the Yellow and East China Seas in winter. The model results show that the shelf circulation in winter is induced primarily by the northerly monsoonal winds. Compared with the wind-driven circulation, the Kuroshio-forced circulation over the shelf is very weak. The westward shift of the Yellow Sea Warm Current is produced by the northerly winds through the generation of a sea-level trough off the Subei coasts and a sea-level ridge along the center of the Yellow Sea topographic trough. The sea-level trough off the Subei coasts is produced because the sea level at the coast is tied to the depression in the northern Yellow Sea and is moderated by the surface Ekman transport of the northerly monsoon. The sea-level ridge along the center of the Yellow Sea topographic trough is produced because the sea level along both the east China and the west Korea coasts decreases. The structure of the sea level gives rise to a geostrophic intrusion against the wind along the western side of the Yellow Sea trough and southward movement of the Korean coastal currents along the eastern side of the trough.},

  abstract = {The mean vertical structure of mesoscale eddies in the Peru-Chile Current System is investigated by combining the historical records of Argo float profiles and satellite altimetry data. A composite average of 420 (526) profiles acquired by Argo floats that surfaced into cyclonic (anticyclonic) mesoscale eddies allowed constructing the mean three-dimensional eddy structure of the eastern South Pacific Ocean. Key differences in their thermohaline vertical structure were revealed. The core of cyclonic eddies (CEs) is centered at {$\sim$}150 m depth within the 25.2{\textendash}26.0 kg m-3 potential density layer corresponding to the thermocline. In contrast, the core of the anticyclonic eddies (AEs) is located below the thermocline at {$\sim$}400 m depth impacting the 26.0{\textendash}26.8 kg m-3 density layer. This difference was attributed to the mechanisms involved in the eddy formation. While intrathermocline CEs would be formed by instabilities of the surface equatorward coastal currents, the subthermocline AEs are likely to be shed by the subsurface poleward Peru-Chile Undercurrent. In the eddy core, maximum temperature and salinity anomalies are of {$\pm$}1{\textdegree}C and {$\pm$}0.1, with positive (negative) values for AEs (CEs). This study also provides new insight into the potential impact of mesoscale eddies for the cross-shore transport of heat and salt in the eastern South Pacific. Considering only the fraction of the water column associated with the fluid trapped within the eddies, each CE and AE has a typical volume anomaly flux of {$\sim$}0.1 Sv and yields to a heat and salt transport anomaly of {$\pm$}1{\textendash}3 {\texttimes} 1011 W and {$\pm$}3{\textendash}8 {\texttimes} 103 kg s-1, respectively.},

The thickness of the mixed layer determines the heat content and mechanical inertia of the layer that directly interacts with the atmosphere. Existing methods for determining mixed layer depth from profile data have large uncertainty. Objective and accurate determination of the mixed layer depth is crucial in ocean dynamics and climate change. This paper describes recently developed optimal linear fitting, maximum angle, and relative gradient methods to determine mixed layer depth from profile data. Profiles from the Global Temperature and Salinity Profile Program (GTSPP) during 1990-2010 are used to demonstrate the capability of these objective methods and to build up global mixed (isothermal) layer depth datasets. Application of the data in climate study is also discussed.},

This chapter presents two primary mechanisms by which instability may occur: motion of individual particles (called inertial instability) and organized motions across the flow (called baroclinic instability). In each case, kinetic energy is supplied to the disturbance by release of potential energy from the original flow. Baroclinic instability is at the origin of the midlatitude cyclones and anticyclones that make our weather so variable. Because the evolution of weather perturbations is essentially nonlinear, a two-layer quasi-geostrophic model is presented here to simulate the evolution of the baroclinic instability past the linear-growth phase.},

  abstract = {When a drifter is trapped in an eddy, it makes either a cycloidal or a looping trajectory. The former case takes place when the translating speed is larger than the eddy spinning speed. When the background mean velocity is removed, drifter trajectories make loops. Thus, eddies can be detected from a drifter trajectory by identifying looping segments. In this paper, an automated scheme is developed to identify looping segments from Lagrangian trajectories, based on a geometric definition of a loop, that is, a closing curve with its starting point overlapped by its ending point. The scheme is to find the first returning point, if it exists, along a trajectory of a surface drifter with a few other criteria. To further increase the chance that detected loops are eddies, it is considered that a loop identifies an eddy only when the loop's spinning period is longer than the local inertial period and shorter than the seasonal scale, and that at least two consecutive loops with the same polarity that stay sufficiently close are found. Five parameters that characterize an eddy are estimated by the scheme: location (eddy center), time (starting and ending time), period, polarity, and intensity. As an example, the scheme is applied to surface drifters in the Kuroshio Extension region. Results indicate that numbers of eddies are symmetrically distributed for cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies, mean eddy sizes are 40{\textendash}50 km, and eddy abundance is the highest along the Kuroshio path with more cyclonic eddies along its southern flank.},

Satellite-measured SST images can therefore be used to obtain information of the characteristics of oceanic eddies. Remotely sensed measurements represent very large data sets, both spatially and temporally. Manual eddy detection and analysis are thus practically impossible. In this letter, an automated scheme for eddy detection from remote sensing SST data is presented. The method is based on the analysis of velocity fields derived from SST measurements (thermal-wind velocity field). Using the geometric features of the velocity field, we can identify positions of eddy centers and derive eddy size, intensity, path, and lifetime. The scheme is applied to a realistic remotely sensed SST data set in a strong eddy activity region: Kuroshio Extension region.},

By the end of the month the preevent temperatures had slowly recovered. The Regional Oceanic Model System (ROMS) is used to simulate the event with an atmospheric downscaling reanalysis for surface wind and buoyancy flux forcing. Lateral boundary conditions of temperature, salinity, velocity, and sea level are taken from a global oceanic product. Barotropic tidal fields from a global barotropic model are imposed along the open boundaries. The simulation reproduces well the upwelling process compared with observed data. The sensitivity of the simulation is examined to wind resolution, heat flux, and tidal forcing. The oceanic response to the different wind resolutions converges at the level of the 6 km resolution, which is the finest scale present in the terrain elevation data set used in the atmospheric downscaling. The combination of an analytical diurnal cycle in the solar radiation and the empirical coupling with the instantaneous ROMS sea surface temperature produces a similar oceanic response to the downscaled heat flux. Tidal effects are significant in the upwelling evolution due to the increase in wind energy input through a quasi-resonant alignment of the wind and surface current, probably by chance.},

Individual characteristics of the eddies including amplitude decay, horizontal length scale decay, and zonal and meridional propagation speed of a previously unrecognized quasi-stable state are examined. The results show that the meridional deflections from purely westward flow (poleward for cyclones and equatorward for anticyclones) are consistent with satellite observations.

  abstract = {The dynamic structure of an ocean eddy in the eddy-abundant South China Sea has rarely been captured by measurements and has seldom been discussed in the literature. In the present study, in situ current and hydrographic measurements from a weeklong cruise and concurrent satellite altimeter observations were utilized to examine the three-dimensional structure and physical properties of a cold eddy in the southwestern South China Sea. The underlying forcing mechanism for the formation of this cyclonic cold eddy was found to be tightly associated with the recirculation in a coastal baroclinic jet that had separated off the Vietnamese coast. The eddy was significantly influenced by a coexisting, anticyclonic warm eddy in the separated jet. With relatively steady intensity and radius, the cold eddy endured for two weeks after its swift formation in late August and prior to its quick dissipation in mid-September. This cold eddy was horizontally and vertically heterogeneous. Asymmetric currents with much stronger magnitude were found on its southeastern flank, next to the warm eddy, where a front in the pycnocline was responsible for the sharp decrease in the cold eddy's intensity in the water below. The distributions of temperature, vorticity, and vertical velocity in the cold eddy were spatially asymmetric and not overlapping. The intensity of the cold eddy gradually decreased with the depth and the eddy extended downward for more than 250 m with a vertically tilted central axis. The upward velocities around the center of the eddy and the downward velocities to the southwest and to the east of the center jointly formed the upward domes of isotherms and isohalines in the central part of the cold eddy.},

The observed sea level anomaly data show that this region is the only eastern basin among the global oceans where strong eddy activity exists. Furthermore, the eddy kinetic energy (EKE) level in this region displays a distinct seasonal cycle with the maximum in austral summer and minimum in austral winter. It is found that this seasonal modulation of EKE is mediated by baroclinic instability associated with the surface-intensified South Indian Countercurrent (SICC) and the underlying South Equatorial Current (SEC) system. In austral spring and summer the enhanced flux forcing of combined meridional Ekman and geostrophic convergence strengthens the upper-ocean meridional temperature gradient, intensifying the SICC front and its vertical velocity shear. Modulation of the vertical velocity shear results in the seasonal changes in the strength of baroclinic instability, leading to the seasonal EKE variations in the southeast Indian Ocean.},

In late winter, two zonally elongated bands of deep mixed layer extend at 338{\textendash}398 and 398{\textendash}438N, from the east coast of Japan to 1608W. These correspond to the formation region of the lighter variety of CMW (L-CMW) and that of the denser variety of CMW (D-CMW) and the recently identified transition region mode water (TRMW), respectively. In the western part of the L-CMW and D-CMW{\textendash}TRMW formation regions west of 1708E, the winter mixed layer becomes deeper and lighter to the east (i.e., to the downstream). As a result, the formed mode water is reentrained into the mixed layer in the farther east in the following winter and modified to the lighter water and is thus unable to be subducted to the permanent pycnocline. In the eastern part of the formation regions between 1708E and 1608W, on the other hand, the winter mixed layer becomes shallower and lighter to the east. From these areas, the L-CMW with potential density of 25.7{\textendash}26.2 kg m23 and the D-CMW{\textendash}TRMW (mostly the former) of 26.1{\textendash}26.4 kg m23 are subducted to the permanent pycnocline, and they are then advected anticyclonically in the subtropical gyre. These results imply that during the analysis period large-scale subduction to the permanent pycnocline occurs in the density range up to 26.4 kg m23 in the open North Pacific, whereas the winter mixed layer density reaches the maximum of 26.6 kg m23. This is supported by the vertical distribution of apparent oxygen utilization in a hydrographic section in the subtropical gyre.},

The radial scale of the two eddies is similar, but whereas the cyclone is strongly surface intensified, the anticyclone has its maximum expression with near{\textendash}solid body rotation between 200 and 800 m depth. The anticyclone has a minimum in relative vorticity very close to -f at 800 m depth and the cyclone has a maximum of about +1.6 f close to the surface where f is the local Coriolis parameter. By integrating the momentum equation the geopotential anomaly field and hence the potential energy of the eddies can be determined quite accurately, which means that the kinetic and potential energy of the eddies can be determined purely through acoustic remote sensing. Given a density profile just outside the eddy one can integrate the gradient wind equation to obtain an estimate of the density and hence potential vorticity fields through the two eddies. The acoustic backscatter patterns in the eddies are quite distinct from the surrounding waters. The backscatter intensity of the main scattering layer at {$\sim$}600 m depth decreases by {$\sim$}10 dB in the core of both eddies. In the cyclonic eddy three identifiable scattering layers in the main thermocline show a strong tendency for the scattering layer to track the shoaling density structure toward the center of the eddy.},

The first method is based on the wavelet packet decomposition of the SLA data, the second on the estimation of the Okubo-Weiss parameter and the third on a geometric criterion using the winding-angle approach. The results provide a comprehensive picture of the mesoscale eddies over the South Atlantic Ocean, emphasizing their main characteristics: amplitude, diameter, duration and propagation velocity. Five areas of particular eddy dynamics were selected: the Brazil Current, the Agulhas eddies propagation corridor, the Agulhas Current retroflexion, the Brazil-Malvinas confluence zone and the northern branch of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC). For these areas, mean propagation velocities and amplitudes were calculated. Two regions with long duration eddies were observed, corresponding to the propagation of Agulhas and ACC eddies. Through the comparison between the identification methods, their main advantages and shortcomings were detailed. The geometric criterion presents the best performance, mainly in terms of number of detections, duration of the eddies and propagation velocities. The results are particularly good for the Agulhas Rings, which have the longest lifetimes of all South Atlantic eddies.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Abstract Variations of turbulent heat fluxes (sum of sensible and latent heat fluxes) in the North Pacific during 16 winters from December 1992/February 1993 to December 2007/February 2008 are investigated because the months from December to February correspond to the period having peak winter conditions in the atmosphere field. Turbulent heat fluxes are calculated from the bulk formula using daily variables [surface wind speed, surface air specific humidity, surface air temperature, and sea surface temperature (SST)] of the objectively analyzed air{\textendash}sea flux (OAFlux) dataset and bulk coefficients based on the Tropical Ocean and Global Atmosphere Coupled Ocean{\textendash}Atmosphere Response Experiment (TOGA COARE) bulk flux algorithm 3.0. The winter turbulent heat fluxes over the Kuroshio{\textendash}Oyashio Confluence Region (KOCR; 142{\textdegree}{\textendash}150{\textdegree}E, 35{\textdegree}{\textendash}40{\textdegree}N) have the largest temporal variances in the North Pacific. The relative contributions among observed variables in SST, surface air temperature, and surface wind speed causing turbulent heat flux variations in the KOCR are assessed quantitatively by performing simple experiments using combinations of two types of variables: raw daily data and daily climatological data. Results show that SST is primarily responsible for the turbulent heat flux variations{\textemdash}a huge amount of heat is released in the state of the positive SST anomaly. Using the datasets of satellite-derived SST and sea surface height with high spatial and temporal resolutions, it is found that the SST anomalies in the KOCR are formed through activities of the anticyclonic (warm) eddies detached northward from the Kuroshio Extension; SSTs take positive (negative) anomalies when more (less) anticyclonic eddies are distributed there, associated with a more convoluted (straight) Kuroshio Extension path.},

  abstract = {Abstract An observational, modeling, and theoretical study of the scales, growth rates, and spectral fluxes of baroclinic instability in the ocean is presented, permitting a discussion of the relation between the local instability scale; the first baroclinic deformation scale Rdef; and the equilibrated, observed eddy scale. The geography of the large-scale, meridional quasigeostrophic potential vorticity (QGPV) gradient is mapped out using a climatological atlas, and attention is drawn to asymmetries between midlatitude eastward currents and subtropical return flows, the latter of which has westward and eastward zonal velocity shears. A linear stability analysis of the climatology, under the ``local approximation,'' yields the growth rates and scales of the fastest-growing modes. Fastest-growing modes on eastward-flowing currents, such as the Kuroshio and the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, have a scale somewhat larger (by a factor of about 2) than Rdef. They are rapidly growing (e folding in 1{\textendash}3 weeks) and deep reaching, and they can be characterized by an interaction between interior QGPV gradients, with a zero crossing in the QGPV gradient at depth. In contrast, fastest-growing modes in the subtropical return flows (as well as much of the gyre interiors) have a scale smaller than Rdef (by a factor of between 0.5 and 1), grow more slowly (e-folding scale of several weeks), and owe their existence to the interaction of a positive surface QGPV gradient and a negative gradient beneath. These predictions of linear theory under the local approximation are then compared to observed eddy length scales and spectral fluxes using altimetric data. It is found that the scale of observed eddies is some 2{\textendash}3 times larger than the instability scale, indicative of a modest growth in horizontal scale. No evidence of an inverse cascade over decades in scale is found. Outside of a tropical band, the eddy scale varies with latitude along with but somewhat less strongly than Rdef. Finally, exactly the same series of calculations is carried out on fields from an idealized global eddying model, enabling study in a more controlled setting. Broadly similar conclusions are reached, thus reinforcing inferences made from the data.},

In this study, Argo temperature and salinity measurements during the period 2005 to 2010 are used to estimate Global Ocean Indicators (GOIs) such as global ocean heat content (GOHC), global ocean freshwater content (GOFC) and global steric sea level (GSSL). We developed a method based on a simple box averaging scheme using a weighted mean. Uncertainties due to data processing methods and choice of climatology are estimated. This method is easy to implement and run and can be used to set up a routine monitoring of the global ocean. Over the six year time period, trends of GOHC and GSSL are 0.54 {$\pm$} 0.1 W m-2 and 0.75 {$\pm$} 0.15 mm yr-1, respectively. The trend of GOFC is barely significant. Results show that there is significant interannual variability at global scale, especially for GOFC. Annual mean GOIs from the today's Argo sampling can be derived with an accuracy of {$\pm$}0.11 cm for GSSL, {$\pm$}0.22 {\texttimes} 108 J m-2 for GOHC, and {$\pm$}700 km3 for GOFC. Long-term trends (15 yr) of GOIs based on the complete Argo sampling for the upper 1500 m depth can be estimated with an accuracy of {$\pm$}0.04 mm yr-1 for GSSL, {$\pm$}0.02 W m-2 for GOHC and {$\pm$}20 km3 yr-1 for GOFC {\textendash} under the assumption that no systematic errors remain in the observing system.},

A picture of the 2-yr record mean jet structure is presented in both geographical and stream coordinates, revealing important contrasts in jet strength, width, vertical structure, and flanking recirculation structure. Eddy variability observed is discussed in the context of some of its various sources: jet meandering, rings, waves, and jet instability. Finally, various scenarios for eddy{\textendash}mean flow interaction consistent with the observations are explored. It is shown that the observed cross-jet distributions of Reynolds stresses at the KESS location are consistent with wave radiation away from the jet, with the sense of the eddy feedback effect on the mean consistent with eddy driving of the observed recirculations. The authors consider these results in the context of a broader description of eddy{\textendash}mean flow interactions in the larger KE region using KESS data in combination with in situ measurements from past programs in the region and satellite altimetry. This demonstrates important consistencies in the along-stream development of time-mean and eddy properties in the KE with features of an idealized model of a western boundary current (WBC) jet used to understand the nature and importance of eddy{\textendash}mean flow interactions in WBC jet systems.},

The study focuses on two issues not covered by existing studies: the effects of finite baroclinic deformation radii and time dependence perturbed by mesoscale eddies. The results of the study show that the hysteresis of the WBC of finite baroclinic deformation radii is not controlled by multiple steady-state balances of the quasigeostrophic vorticity equation. Instead, the hysteresis is controlled by the periodic penetrating and the leaping regimes of the vorticity balance. The regime of the vorticity balance inside the gap is dependent on the history of the WBC evolution, which gives rise to the hysteresis of the WBC path. Numerical experiments have shown that the parameter domain of the hysteresis is not sensitive to the baroclinic deformation radius. However, the domain of the periodic solution, which is determined by the lower Hopf bifurcation of the nonlinear system, is found to be sensitive to the magnitude of the baroclinic deformation radius. The lower Hopf bifurcation from steady penetration to periodic penetration is found to occur at lower Reynolds numbers for larger deformation radii. In general, the lower Hopf bifurcation stays outside the hysteresis domain of the Reynolds number. However, for very small deformation radii, the lower Hopf bifurcation falls inside the hysteresis domain, which results in the transition from the leaping to the penetrating regimes of the WBC to skip the periodic regime and hence the disappearance of the upper Hopf bifurcation.},

By applying an automated eddy detection scheme to a 12 year high-resolution numerical product of the oceanic circulation in the SCB, a three-dimensional eddy data set is developed. It includes information for each eddy's location, polarity, intensity, size, boundary, and moving path at nine vertical levels. Through a series of statistical analyses applied to the eddy data set, three-dimensional statistical characteristics of mesoscale and submeoscale eddy variations in the SCB are elucidated; these shed light on how eddies are generated, evolve, and terminate. A significant percentage of eddies is found to be generated around islands and headlands along the coastline, which indicates that islands in the SCB play a vital role in eddy generation. Three types of eddies, based on shape, are identified from the numerical product: bowl, lens, and cone. A dynamic analysis shows that some submesoscale eddies with finite local Rossby numbers tend to be ageostrophic balanced while mesoscale eddies are in geostrophic balance. The present research results are useful for the interpretation of data sets obtained during the interdisciplinary Santa Barbara Channel Radiance in a Dynamic Ocean (RaDyo) field experiment conducted on September 3{\textendash}25, 2008.},

Increasing the knowledge base is constrained by the inability of traditional sampling methods to adequately sample biological processes at the spatio-temporal scales at which they occur. By combining satellite and acoustic observations over spatial scales of 10 s of km horizontally and 100 s of m vertically, supported by hydrographical and biological sampling we show that anticyclonic eddies shape distribution and density of marine life from the surface to bathyal depths. Fish feed along density structures of eddies, demonstrating that eddies catalyze energy transfer across trophic levels. Eddies create attractive pelagic habitats, analogous to oases in the desert, for higher trophic level aquatic organisms through enhanced 3-D motion that accumulates and redistributes biomass, contributing to overall bioproduction in the ocean. Integrating multidisciplinary observation methodologies promoted a new understanding of biophysical interaction in mesoscale eddies. Our findings emphasize the impact of eddies on the patchiness of biomass in the sea and demonstrate that they provide rich feeding habitat for higher trophic marine life.},

Yet, substantial differences in net primary production (NPP) exist within and between these systems for reasons that are still not fully understood. Here, we explore the leading physical processes and environmental factors controlling NPP in EBUS through a comparative study of the California, Canary, Benguela, and Humboldt Current systems. The NPP drivers are identified with the aid of an artificial neural network analysis based on self-organizing-maps (SOM). Our results suggest that in addition to the expected NPP enhancing effect of stronger equatorward alongshore wind, three factors have an inhibiting effect: (1) strong eddy activity, (2) narrow continental shelf, and (3) deep mixed layer. The co-variability of these 4 drivers defines in the context of the SOM a continuum of 100 patterns of NPP regimes in EBUS. These are grouped into 4 distinct classes using a Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering (HAC) method. Our objective classification of EBUS reveals important variations of NPP regimes within each of the four EBUS, particularly in the Canary and Benguela Current systems. Our results show that the Atlantic EBUS are generally more productive and more sensitive to upwelling favorable winds because of weaker factors inhibiting NPP. Perturbations of alongshore winds associated with climate change may therefore lead to contrasting biological responses in the Atlantic and the Pacific EBUS.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Such movement creates a net poleward transport of heat that, in partnership with the atmosphere, establishes the global and regional climates. Although oceanographers have long assumed that a reduction in deep water formation at high latitudes in the North Atlantic translates into a slowing of the ocean's overturning and hence in Earth's climate, observational and modeling studies over the past decade have called this assumed linkage into question. The observational basis for linking water mass formation with the ocean's meridional overturning is reviewed herein. Understanding this linkage is crucial to efforts aimed at predicting the consequences of the warming and freshening of high-latitude surface waters to the climate system.},

Since 1992, we have had an unprecedented 18year high-resolution monitoring of the ocean mesoscale field. Altimetry is often used in mesoscale studies in synergy with other remote sensing techniques and in situ data. This global, high-resolution data set has allowed oceanographers to quantify the previously unknown seasonal and interannual variations in eddy kinetic energy and eddy heat and salt transports, and investigate their causes. Eddy tracking techniques have allowed us to monitor their propagation pathways, to bring to light the meridional divergence of cyclones and anticyclones, and to question the role of Rossby waves versus non-linear eddies in the mid to high latitude bands. Altimetry has also revealed the presence of zonal fronts and jets everywhere in the ocean, and brought to light how mesoscale eddies can impact back onto the atmospheric circulation. Finally, altimetry, in synergy with other observations and high-resolution numerical models, has helped reveal the complexity of the sub-mesoscale features, associated with stirring and mixing around the mesoscale eddies, of great importance for the vertical exchange of oceanic tracers. Altimetry has revealed the complexity of the mesoscale system{\ldots} the scientific community is now working to understand the interplay between these mesoscale eddies, the ocean interior and its impact on the overlying atmosphere.},

The model reproduces the mean and seasonal variability of sea surface temperature, as well as mesoscale eddies and meanders from satellite observations. The model adequately represents the main currents in the region: California Current, Mexican Coastal Current, and Gulf of California currents. The Gulf of California currents are linked to the intensification of the Mexican Coastal Current and interact in such a way that the lateral shear generates eddies at the entrance to the Gulf of California. The mesoscale eddies were found to have a depth of {\textasciitilde}200 m. The eddies generated in the area (internal Rossby radius of deformation, Rd = 40 km) had a diameter L of {\textasciitilde}300 km, an orbital speed of 20{\textendash}30 cm s{\textendash}1, and a westward translation speed of {\textasciitilde}4 cm s{\textendash}1. Eddies are considered from intermediate to big (L  7.5 Rd, Ro {$<<$} 1), show geostrophic dynamics, and present a westward drift due to Coriolis variation with latitude (beta effect). The size of the eddies seems to be related to the weakening of the meridional component of wind stress during the North American monsoon.},

This rate is 3 times faster than the global-mean value of the sea level rise. Analyses of the satellite altimeter data and repeat hydrographic data along 1378E reveal that this regionally enhanced sea level rise is thermosteric in nature and vertically confined to a patch in the upper ocean above the 128C isotherm. Dynamically, this regional sea level trend is accompanied by southward migration and strengthening of the North Equatorial Current (NEC) and North Equatorial Countercurrent (NECC). Using a 1{$\frac{1}{2}$}layer reduced-gravity model forced by the ECMWF reanalysis wind stress data, the authors find that both the observed sea level rise and the NEC/NECC's southward migrating and strengthening trends are largely attributable to the upper-ocean water mass redistribution caused by the surface wind stresses of the recently strengthened atmospheric Walker circulation. Based on the long-term model simulation, it is further found that the observed southward migrating and strengthening trends of the NEC and NECC began in the early 1990s. In the two decades prior to 1993, the NEC and NECC had weakened and migrated northward in response to a decrease in the trade winds across the tropical Pacific Ocean.},

  abstract = {This paper presents an estimate of the oceanic Lorenz energy cycle derived from a 1/10{\textdegree} simulation forced by 6-hourly fluxes obtained from NCEP{\textendash}NCAR reanalysis-1. The total rate of energy generation amounts to 6.6 TW, of which 1.9 TW is generated by the time-mean winds and 2.2 TW by the time-varying winds. The dissipation of kinetic energy amounts to 4.4 TW, of which 3 TW originate from the dissipation of eddy kinetic energy. The energy exchange between reservoirs is dominated by the baroclinic pathway and the pathway that distributes the energy generated by the time-mean winds. The former converts 0.7 to 0.8 TW mean available potential energy to eddy available potential energy and finally to eddy kinetic energy, whereas the latter converts 0.5 TW mean kinetic energy to mean available potential energy.},

  abstract = {Mesoscale anticyclonic eddies are a common feature in the Gulf of Alaska (GOA). A three-dimensional circulation model is used to examine the general characteristics of eddies in the GOA during 1993{\textendash}2009. Using an eddy detection algorithm, we tracked on average 6.5 eddies formed each year from the modeled results and 6.9 eddies from altimeter data. Modeled eddy characteristics agree with the remote sensing derived eddy statistics in terms of eddy magnitude, propagation speed, and eddycore diameter. From the model results, strong seasonal and interannual variations were found in both the number and areal coverage of GOA eddies. At the seasonal scale, more eddies are observed to form from March to May, while the eddy-covered area usually peaks around October. At the interannual scale, our results suggest the years with large eddy-covered area do not necessarily have more eddies generated. The long-term variation of eddy-covered area in the GOA is modulated by El Nin{\texttildelow} o/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events through altering the local wind stress. Model results indicate one typical Haida eddy could transport 37 {\^A} 1018 J of heat and 27 km3 of freshwater from the shelf to the central gulf. The equivalent fluxes caused by Haida eddies are comparable with the annual mean of net heat flux and freshwater flux from the atmosphere into the ocean in the Haida region, implying that mesoscale eddies are important sources contributing to the heat and freshwater budgets.},

  abstract = {The Kuroshio Extension System Study (KESS) provided 16 months of observations to quantify divergent eddy heat flux (DEHF) from a mesoscale-resolving array of current- and pressure-equipped inverted echo sounders. KESS observations captured a regime shift from a stable to unstable state. There is a distinct difference in the spatial structure of DEHFs between the two regimes. The stable regime had weak downgradient DEHFs. The unstable regime exhibited asymmetry along the mean path with strong downgradient DEHFs upstream of a mean trough at ;1478E. The spatial structure of DEHFs resulted from episodic mesoscale processes. The first 6 months were during the stable regime in which fluxes were associated with eastward-propagating 10{\textendash}15-day upper meanders. After 6 months, the Kuroshio Extension underwent a regime shift from a stable to unstable state. This regime shift corresponded with a red shift in mesoscale phenomena with the prevalence of ;40-day deep externally generated eddies. DEHF amplitudes more than quadrupled during the unstable regime. Cold-core ring (CCR) formation, CCR{\textendash}jet interaction, and coupling between ;40-day deep eddies were responsible for asymmetry in downgradient fluxes in the mean maps not observed during the stable regime. The Kuroshio Extension has prominent deep energy associated with externally generated eddies that interact with the jet to drive some of the biggest DEHF events. These eddies play an important role in the variability of the jet through eddy{\textendash}mean flow interactions. The DEHFs that result from vertical coupling act in accordance with baroclinic instability. The interaction is not growth from an infinitesimal perturbation, but from the start is a finite-amplitude interaction.},

  abstract = {The Kuroshio Extension System Study (KESS) provided 16 months of observations to quantify eddy heat flux (EHF) from a mesoscale-resolving array of current- and pressure-equipped inverted echo sounders (CPIES). The mapped EHF estimates agreed well with point in situ measurements from subsurface current meter moorings. Geostrophic currents determined with the CPIES separate the vertical structure into an equivalent-barotropic internal mode and a nearly depth-independent external mode measured in the deep ocean. As a useful by-product of this decomposition, the divergent EHF (DEHF) arises entirely from the correlation between the external mode and the upper-ocean thermal front. EHFs associated with the internal mode are completely rotational. DEHFs were mostly downgradient and strongest just upstream of a mean trough at ;1478E. The downgradient DEHFs resulted in a mean-to-eddy potential energy conversion rate that peaked midthermocline with a magnitude of 10 3 1023 cm2 s23 and a depth-averaged value of 3 3 1023 cm2 s23. DEHFs were vertically coherent, with subsurface maxima exceeding 400 kW m22 near 400-m depth. The subsurface maximum DEHFs occurred near the depth where the quasigeostrophic potential vorticity lateral gradient changes sign from one layer to the next below it. The steering level is deeper than this depth of maximum DEHFs. A downgradient parameterization could be fitted to the DEHF vertical structure with a constant eddy diffusivity k that had values of 800{\textendash}1400 m2 s21 along the mean path. The resulting divergent meridional eddy heat transport across the KESS array was 0.05 PW near 35.258N, which may account for ;1/3 of the total Pacific meridional heat transport at this latitude.},

  abstract = {Finite amplitude instability of an idealized tidal mixing front is considered for cases where there is an active symmetric instability during the early stages of evolution. This can happen either when the initial front is sharp, or when a bottom stress leads to a well-mixed bottom boundary layer under the front. In either case, there is an initial phase, several days long, of slantwise convection, after which a much more energetic and spatially distributed baroclinic or barotropic instability dominates. The presence of an initial symmetrically unstable phase has no obvious effect on the subsequent eddy evolution. Bottom friction does lead to a slower growth rate for baroclinic instabilities, a lower eddy kinetic energy level, and (through stratified spindown) a tendency for flows to be more nearly surface intensified. The surface intensification means that the evolving eddy field cannot proceed toward a barotropic state, and so the horizontal eddy scale is also constrained. Thus, the finite-amplitude inverse cascade is strongly affected by the presence of a bottom stress. Scalings are derived for the frictionally corrected eddy kinetic energy and lateral mixing coefficient. The results, in terms of frictional effects on eddy structure and energy, appear to be valid beyond just the tidal mixing frontal problem.},

  abstract = {Data from the Kuroshio Extension Observatory (KEO) surface mooring are used to analyze the balance of processes affecting the upper ocean heat content and surface mixed layer temperature variations in the Recirculation Gyre (RG) south of the Kuroshio Extension (KE). Cold and dry air blowing across the KE and its warm RG during winter cause very large heat fluxes out of the ocean that result in the erosion of the seasonal thermocline in the RG. Some of this heat is replenished through horizontal heat advection, which may enable the seasonal thermocline to begin restratifying while the net surface heat flux is still acting to cool the upper ocean. Once the surface heat flux begins warming the ocean, restratification occurs rapidly due to the low thermal inertia of the shallow mixed layer depth. Enhanced diffusive mixing below the mixed layer tends to transfer some of the mixed layer heat downward, eroding and potentially modifying sequestered subtropical mode water and even the deeper waters of the main thermocline during winter. Diffusivity at the base of the mixed layer, estimated from the residual of the mixed layer temperature balance, is roughly 3 {\^A} 10{\`A}4 m2/s during the summer and up to two orders of magnitude larger during winter. The enhanced diffusivities appear to be due to large inertial shear generated by wind events associated with winter storms and summer tropical cyclones. The diffusivity's seasonality is likely due to seasonal variations in stratification just below the mixed layer depth, which is large during the summer when the seasonal thermocline is fully developed and low during the winter when the mixed layer extends to the top of the thermocline.},

  abstract = {Mesoscale eddies play a substantial role in the dynamics of the ocean, but the dominant length-scale of these eddies varies greatly with latitude, stratification and ocean depth. Global numerical ocean models with spatial resolutions ranging from 1{\textdegree} down to just a few kilometers include both regions where the dominant eddy scales are well resolved and regions where the model's resolution is too coarse for the eddies to form, and hence eddy effects need to be parameterized. However, common parameterizations of eddy effects via a Laplacian diffusion of the height of isopycnal surfaces (a Gent{\textendash}McWilliams diffusivity) are much more effective at suppressing resolved eddies than in replicating their effects. A variant of the Phillips model of baroclinic instability illustrates how eddy effects might be represented in ocean models. The ratio of the first baroclinic deformation radius to the horizontal grid spacing indicates where an ocean model could explicitly simulate eddy effects; a function of this ratio can be used to specify where eddy effects are parameterized and where they are explicitly modeled. One viable approach is to abruptly disable all the eddy parameterizations once the deformation radius is adequately resolved; at the discontinuity where the parameterization is disabled, isopycnal heights are locally flattened on the one side while eddies grow rapidly off of the enhanced slopes on the other side, such that the total parameterized and eddy fluxes vary continuously at the discontinuity in the diffusivity. This approach should work well with various specifications for the magnitude of the eddy diffusivities.},

No direct influence of temperature on aggregate sinking speed was observed.

Mixed layer salinity variations in these two NPTW formation sites were found to be significantly different. While seasonal variation was prominent in the eastern formation site, interannual variation was dominant in the western site. The mixed layer salinity variation in the eastern site was controlled mainly by evaporation, precipitation, and entrainment of fresher water below the mixed layer and was closely related to the seasonal variation of the mixed layer depth. In the western site, the effect of entrainment is small due to a small vertical difference in salinity across the mixed layer base, and excess evaporation over precipitation that tended to be balanced by eddy diffusion, whose strength varied interannually in association with the Pacific decadal oscillation. After subduction, denser NPTW that formed in the eastern site dissipated quickly, while the lighter one that formed in the western site was advected westward as far as the Philippine Sea, transmitting the interannual variation of salinity away from its formation region.},

Eddy activity modulations with a decadal time scale are detected concurrently within the 188{\textendash}288N band, including the three branches of the Subtropical Countercurrent (STCC) and the Hawaiian Lee Countercurrent (HLCC). Lagging behind the Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO) index by six months, enhanced eddy activities were detected in 1995{\textendash}98 and 2003{\textendash}06, whereas the eddy activities were below the average in 1999{\textendash}2002 and 2009{\textendash}11. Analysis of the temperature and salinity data that became available after 2001 via the International Argo Program reveals that the modulating eddy activities are due to the decadal change in the upper-ocean eastward shear in the broad-scale STCC{\textendash}HLCC band. By conducting an upper-ocean temperature budget analysis, the authors found that this observed eastward shear change can be effectively accounted for by the decadal-varying surface heat flux forcing. Using the Argo-based temperature and salinity data, it is further found that the decadal subsurface potential vorticity (PV) signals to the north and beneath the STCC{\textendash}HLCC were vertically coherent and not confined to the mode water isopycnals. Adjusting to the PDO-related surface forcing, these subsurface PV anomalies lagged behind the upper-ocean eastward shear signals and likely made minor contributions to generate the decadal-varying eddy signals observed in the western North Pacific subtropical gyre.},

Analyses of an eddy-resolving global ocean general circulation model output reveal that the NEUC jets have a mode-1 baroclinic vertical structure and are spatially persistent on the interannual and longer time scales. This OGCM-simulated vertical structure prompts the authors to adopt the simpler, nonlinear 11 2-layer reduced-gravity model, as well as the baroclinic Rossby wave triad interaction theory, to unravel the essential processes underlying the NEUC jets. The seed for the NEUC jets originates in annual baroclinic Rossby waves driven by the large-scale surface wind stress forcing. Emanating from the ocean basin's eastern boundary, these wind-forced ``primary'' waves are subject to nonlinear triad interactions and break down offshore where the e-folding time scale of the most unstable triad instability matches the advective time scale of the primary waves. The breakdown boundary of the wind-forced primary waves tends to tilt northeast{\textendash}southwest and, west of this boundary, finite-amplitude eddies emerge, whose meridional scales are set by the most unstable short secondary waves participating in the triad interactions along the breakdown boundary. With their meridional scales set similarly by the short secondary waves, the time-mean zonal jets of characteristics resembling the observed NEUC jets are formed by the converging potential vorticity fluxes of these finite-amplitude eddies.},

Eddies are commonly referred to the so-called mesoscale or submesoscale eddies; by definition, they have horizontal scales from 1 to 500 km and vertical scales from meters to hundreds of meters. In one word, the ocean is a turbulent environment; thus, eddy motions are one of the fundamental aspects of oceanic circulation. Studies of these eddies, including observations, theory, laboratory experiments, and parameterization in numerical models, will be the most productive research frontiers for the next 10 to 20 years. Although we have made great efforts to collect data about eddies in the ocean; thus far, we know very little about the three-dimensional structure of these eddies and their contributions to the oceanic general circulation and climate. Therefore, the most important breakthrough may come from observations and physical reasoning about the fundament aspects of eddy structure and their contributions to ocean circulation and climate.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Mesoscale eddies seem to play an important role for both the hydrography and biogeochemistry of the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean (ETSP) off Peru. However, detailed surveys of these eddies are not available, which has so far hampered an in depth understanding of their implications for nutrient distribution and biological productivity. In this study, three eddies along a section at 16{\textdegree}45{\textasciiacute} S have been surveyed intensively during R/V Meteor cruise M90 in November 2012. A coastal mode water eddy, an open ocean mode water eddy and an open ocean cyclonic eddy have been identified and sampled in order to determine both their hydrographic properties and their influence on the biogeochemical setting of the ETSP. In the thermocline the temperature of the coastal anticyclonic eddy was up to 2 {\textdegree}C warmer, 0.2 more saline and the swirl velocity was up to 35 cm s-1. The observed temperature and salinity anomalies, as well as swirl velocities of both types of eddies were about twice as large as had been described for the mean eddies in the ETSP. The observed heat and salt anomalies (AHA, ASA) of the anticyclonic eddy near the shelf-break of 17.7 {\texttimes} 1018 J and 36.6 {\texttimes} 1010 kg are more than twice as large as the mean AHA and ASA for the ETSP. We found that the eddies contributed to the productivity by maintaining pronounced subsurface maxima of chlorophyll of up to 6 {$\mu$}g L-1. Based on a comparison of the coastal (young) mode water eddy and the open ocean (old) mode water eddy we suggest that the ageing of eddies when they detach from the shelf-break and move westward to the open ocean influences the eddies' properties: chlorophyll maxima are reduced to about half (2.5{\textendash}3 {$\mu$}g L-1) and nutrients are subducted. However, different settings at the time of formation may also contribute to the observed differences between the young and old mode water eddies. The coastal mode water eddy was found to be a site of nitrogen (N) loss in the OMZ with a maximum {$\Delta$}NO3- anomaly (i.e. N loss) of about -25 {$\mu$}mol L-1 in 250 m water depth, whereas, the open ocean mode water and cyclonic eddies were of minor and negligible importance for the N loss, respectively. Our results show that the important role of eddies for the distribution of nutrients, as well as biogeochemical processes in the ETSP (and other OMZ/upwelling regions) can only be fully deciphered and understood through dedicated high spatial and temporal resolution oceanographic/biogeochemical surveys.},

  abstract = {Previous observation and model studies show that the upper-ocean stratification is enhanced under global warming (Capotondi et al.; Cravatte et al.; Deser et al., etc.). The response of the recirculation, which is associated with the western boundary current (WBC) jet extension and significantly increases its transport, to the intensified stratification, is studied in a two-layer quasigeostrophic ocean circulation model. It is found that the barotropic transport of the circulation first increases with stratification but then decreases as a result of saturation of the surface-layer circulation intensity when the stratification exceeds a threshold. PV budget analysis indicates that the saturation is caused by the increased intergyre transport of relative potential vorticity resulting from the intensified variability of the jet location. Both the barotropic instability and bifurcation mechanisms contribute to the intensified variability of the jet location. Because of barotropic instability, eddies are generated in the confluence region of the WBCs and advected eastward, causing the variability of the jet location. With increased stratification, the surface-layer circulation is strengthened and the barotropic instability is intensified. As a result, the surface flow becomes more variable with excessive eddies and intense variability of the jet. With the increasing stratification, three regimes, each marked by its own variation of the jet location, emerge owing to the successive system bifurcations. In the last two regimes, variability of the jet location is further enhanced by frequent switches among the different dynamic states on multidecadal time scales.},

The lowest values of PV are found within the North Wall of the GS on the isopycnal layer occupied by Eighteen Degree Water, suggesting that processes within the GS may contribute to the formation of this low-PV water mass. In spite of large heat loss, the generation of negative PV was primarily attributable to cross-front advection of dense water over light by Ekman flow driven by winds with a down-front component. Beneath a critical depth, the SBL was stably stratified yet the PV remained negative due to the strong baroclinicity of the current, suggesting that the flow was symmetrically unstable. A large eddy simulation configured with forcing and flow parameters based on the observations confirms that the observed structure of the SBL is consistent with the dynamics of symmetric instability (SI) forced by wind and surface cooling. The simulation shows that both strong turbulence and vertical gradients in density, momentum, and tracers coexist in the SBL of symmetrically unstable fronts.},

Amplitudes of EKE compare well with near-surface observational estimates based on satellite data and results of an eddy-permitting model, but show a low bias in regions where eddies are not generated locally but propagate into, which will likely transfer both to the diffusivities. In agreement with previous studies we find largest diffusivities in the deep Antarctic Circumpolar Current, and in the shallow western boundary and low latitude westward currents. In agreement with analytical consideration, we find that isopycnal diffusivities are increased at the depth of the steering level where unstable waves and mean flow propagate at the same speed, while skew diffusivities exhibit less vertical dependency, and that isopycnal diffusivities are roughly three times larger than skew diffusivities at the steering level. It is shown that the vertical structure of the diffusivities can be explained to a large extent by the effect of the planetary vorticity gradient which leads to a decrease of skew diffusivities at the surface (bottom) and to a downward (upward) shift of the steering level, and thus the maximum of isopycnal diffusivities, for eastward (westward) flow.},

These eddy characteristics are then used to provide a new description of the eddy{\textendash}mean flow interactions observed in terms of different ingredients of the eddy motion. The diagnostics show patterns in average eddy shape, orientation, and propagation that are consistent with the signatures of jet instability in the upstream region and wave radiation in the downstream region. Together they give a feedback onto the mean flow that gives the downstream character of the jet and drives the jet's recirculation gyres. A breakdown of the eddy forcing into contributions from individual terms confirms the expected role of cross-jet gradients in meridional eddy tilt in stabilizing the jet to its barotropic instability; however, it also reveals important roles played by the along-jet evolution of eddy zonal{\textendash}meridional elongation. It is the mean flow forcing derived from these patterns that acts to strengthen and extend the jet downstream and forces the time-mean recirculation gyres. This understanding of the dependence of mean flow forcing on eddy structural properties suggests that failure to adequately resolve eddy elongation could underlie the weakened jet strength, extent, and changed recirculation structure seen in this idealized model for reduced spatial resolutions. Further, it may suggest new ideas for the parameterization of this forcing.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

For this purpose the dataset of the climate of the 20th Century experiment (20C3M) from nine CGCMs reported to IPCC's AR4 are used, while the MRI and MIROC models are examined in detail. Detailed analyses of these two CGCMs reveal that the PDO is mainly affected by ocean heat transport rather than surface heat flux, in particular in the MRI model which has a larger contribution of ocean heat transport to the heat budget. It is found that the ocean heat transport due to Ekman advection versus geostrophic advection contributes differently to the PDO in the western and central North Pacific. Specifically, the strength of PDO tends to be larger for CGCMs with a larger ocean heat transport in the region.},

  abstract = {We present a simple two-step method by which one-dimensional spectra of horizontal velocity and buoyancy measured along a ship track can be decomposed into a wave component consisting of inertia{\textendash}gravity waves and a vortex component consisting of a horizontal flow in geostrophic balance. The method requires certain assumptions for the data regarding stationarity, homogeneity, and horizontal isotropy. In the first step an exact Helmholtz decomposition of the horizontal velocity spectra into rotational and divergent components is performed and in the second step an energy equipartition property of hydrostatic inertia{\textendash}gravity waves is exploited that allows a diagnosis of the wave energy spectrum solely from the observed horizontal velocities. The observed buoyancy spectrum can then be used to compute the residual vortex energy spectrum. Further wave{\textendash}vortex decompositions of the observed fields are possible if additional information about the frequency content of the waves is available. We illustrate the method on two recent oceanic data sets from the North Pacific and the Gulf Stream. Notably, both steps in our new method might be of broader use in the theoretical and observational study of atmosphere and ocean fluid dynamics.},

Eddy detection and eddy tracking algorithms are applied to the satellite observations, and hydrography profiles from floats that surfaced inside eddies are used to construct three-dimensional composites of cyclones and anticyclones. Eddies are characterized by large temperature and salinity anomalies at 500{\textendash}1000 m depth and near the surface, and by small anomalies at 200{\textendash}400 m below the surface at the depth of the North Atlantic Subtropical Mode Water. Anomalies associated with anticyclones are generally larger and found deeper in the water column compared to those due to the presence of cyclones. Geostrophic velocities around eddies generally exceed their translation speed in the top 1000 m of the water column. As such, these eddies can trap water in their interior as they propagate westward. Combining the volume of water inside eddies above their trapping depths with the number of eddies that propagate into the SAB each year, it is estimated that cyclones and anticyclones transport 3.5 6 0.9 Sv and 4.1 6 1.7 Sv onshore toward the Gulf Stream, respectively. The total volume transport of 7.6 6 2.2 Sv represents an important fraction of previous estimates of the onshore transport in the Gulf Stream Recirculation gyre. Since eddies are characterized by large temperature and salinity anomalies, they also contribute significantly to the onshore transport of heat and salt.},

  abstract = {In this paper, seasonal variation of the South Equatorial Current (SEC) bifurcation off the Madagascar coast in the upper south Indian Ocean (SIO) is investigated based on a new climatology derived from the World Ocean Database and 19-year satellite altimeter observations. The mean bifurcation integrated over the upper thermocline is around 188S and reaches the southernmost position in June/July and the northernmost position in November/December, with a north{\textendash}south amplitude of about 18. It is demonstrated that the linear, reduced gravity, long Rossby model, which works well for the North Equatorial Current (NEC) bifurcation in the North Pacific, is insufficient to reproduce the seasonal cycle and the mean position of the SEC bifurcation off the Madagascar coast. This suggests the importance of Madagascar in regulating the SEC bifurcation. Application of Godfrey's island rule reveals that compared to the zero Sverdrup transport latitude, the mean SEC bifurcation is shifted poleward by over 0.88 because of the meridional transport of about 5 Sverdrups (Sv; 1 Sv [ 106 m3 s21) between Madagascar and Australia. A time-dependent linear model that extends the Godfrey's island rule is adopted to examine the seasonal variation of the SEC bifurcation. This time-dependent island rule model simulates the seasonal SEC bifurcation well both in terms of its mean position and peak seasons. It provides a dynamic framework to clarify the baroclinic adjustment processes involved in the presence of an island.},

Eddies are detected by a free-threshold eddy identification algorithm. The results show that the distributions of size, amplitude, propagation speed, and eddy kinetic energy of eddy follow the Rayleigh distribution. The most active regions of eddies are the Kuroshio Extension region, the Subtropical Counter Current zone, and the Northeastern Tropical Pacific region. By contrast, eddies are seldom observed around the center of the eastern part of the North Pacific Subarctic Gyre. The propagation speed and kinetic energy of cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies are almost the same, but anticyclonic eddies possess greater lifespans, sizes, and amplitudes than those of cyclonic eddies. Most eddies in the North Pacific propagate westward except in the Oyashio region. Around the northeastern tropical Pacific and the California currents, cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies propagate westward with slightly equatorward (197{\textdegree} average azimuth relative to east) and poleward (165{\textdegree}) deflection, respectively. This implies that the background current may play an important role in formation of the eddy pathway patterns.},

Several methods have been developed and applied to survey the general kinetic and geometric characteristics of the ocean eddies in the South China Sea (SCS). However, very few studies attempt to examine eddies' internal evolution processes. In this study, we reported a hybrid method to trace eddies' propagation in the SCS based on their internal structures, which are characterized by eddy centers, footprint borders, and composite borders. Eddy identification and tracking results were represented by a GIS-based spatiotemporal model. Information on instant states, dynamic evolution processes, and events of disappearance, reappearance, split, and mergence is stored in a GIS database. Results were validated by comparing against the ten Dongsha Cyclonic Eddies (DCEs) and the three long-lived anticyclonic eddies (ACEs) in the northern SCS, which were reported in previous literature. Our study confirmed the development of these eddies. Furthermore, we found more DCE-like and ACE-like eddies in these areas from 2005 to 2012 in our database. Spatial distribution analysis of disappearing, reappearing, splitting, and merging activities shows that eddies in the SCS tend to cluster to the northwest of Luzon Island, southwest of Luzon Strait, and around the marginal sea of Vietnam. Kuroshio intrusions and the complex sea floor topography in these areas are the possible factors that lead to these spatial clusters.},

In this study, we present an analysis of the influence of mesoscale ocean eddies on near-surface chlorophyll (CHL) estimated from satellite measurements of ocean color. The influences of horizontal advection, trapping, and upwelling/downwelling on CHL are analyzed in an eddy-centric frame of reference by collocating satellite observations to eddy interiors, as defined by their sea surface height signatures. The influence of mesoscale eddies on CHL varies regionally. In most boundary current regions, cyclonic eddies exhibit positive CHL anomalies and anticyclonic eddies contain negative CHL anomalies. In the interior of the South Indian Ocean, however, the opposite occurs. The various mechanisms by which eddies can influence phytoplankton communities are summarized and regions where the observed CHL response to eddies is consistent with one or more of the mechanisms are discussed. This study does not attempt to link the observed regional variability definitively to any particular mechanism but provides a global overview of how eddies influence CHL anomalies.},

  abstract = {Analysis of satellite altimetry observations, transports estimates from a mooring array, as well as output from two different numerical ocean circulation models (ROMS and HYCOM), have been used to investigate the mesoscale eddy properties and transport variability in the Mozambique Channel. The power spectral density of model transports at 17{\textdegree}S indicates the models ability to represent the transport variability at mesoscale frequencies (range between 3yr-1 and 10yr-1). The models have shown an exaggerated representation of the lower frequencies ({\textasciitilde} {$<$}3yr-1), while underestimating the higher frequency signals ({\textasciitilde} {$>$}10yr-1). The overestimation of the seasonal cycle appears in our case not to be related to a misrepresentation of the mesoscale variability. The eddies were identified using an automatic eddy tracking scheme. Both anticyclonic and cyclonic eddies appeared to have a preferred site of formation within the channel. The density distribution showed that the anticyclones exhibited a bi-modal distribution: the first mode was associated with the typical scale for the oceanic mesoscale turbulence, while the second mode was related to the passage of large rings at a frequency of about 4{\textendash}7 per year. On the other hand, cyclonic eddies had a single mode distribution that follows the first baroclinic Rossby radius of deformation, which is a typical scale for the oceanic mesoscale surface eddy variability, suggesting that their formation is associated with baroclinic instability. Eddy mean amplitudes per class of radius ({$<$}100km), increase linearly with increasing radius, while no linear relationship exists for the rings. Different from the rings, the increase in the amplitude of the eddies was consistent with the increase of their life expectancy and travelling distances.},

  abstract = {The westward South Equatorial Current (SEC) and eastward Equatorial Undercurrent (EUC) is a marginally stable current system due to the strong vertical shear. The existence of wavelike motions may locally reduce the Richardson number enough to trigger instabilities. Here, velocity measurements from the Tropical Atmosphere Ocean (TAO) array are used to examine the variability of oscillations within 0.125{\textendash}12 cycles per day (cpd). It is found that the 0.125{\textendash}12-cpd oscillations become more energetic in the presence of strong tropical instability waves (TIWs). The enhancement of shear variance is most pronounced around the EUC core (115 m), while prominent elevation of kinetic energy occurs around 85 m, where the EUC shear is strongest. Particularly, the energetic 0.125{\textendash}12-cpd oscillations during strong TIW seasons do not cycle on a daily basis and are more evident during the southward phase of TIWs. The enhanced 0.125{\textendash}12-cpd oscillations during strong TIW seasons can be ascribed neither to the changing background stratification nor to the vertical migration of EUC core at the corresponding time scales. Its strength is tightly correlated with the EUC shear and, to a lesser extent, the TIW shear. A partial correlation analysis suggests that the correlation to the TIW shear is mainly due to the association between EUC and TIW shear. The strength of the 0.125{\textendash}12-cpd oscillations does not follow the variation of surface wind speed and wind curl, implying that they are not directly generated by surface wind forcing.},

  abstract = {Measurements of Kuroshio Current velocity at the entrance to Luzon Strait along 18.75 N were made with an array of six moorings during June 2012 to June 2013. Strong positive relative vorticity of the order of the planetary vorticity f was observed on the western flank of the Kuroshio in the upper 150 m. On the eastern flank, the negative vorticity observed was about an order of magnitude smaller than f. Kuroshio transport near its origin is computed from direct measurements for the first time. Kuroshio transport has an annual mean of 15 Sv with a standard deviation of 3 Sv. It is modulated strongly by impinging westward propagating eddies, which are identified by an improved eddy detection method and tracked back to the interior ocean. Eight Kuroshio transport anomalies {$>$}5 Sv are identified; seven are explained by the westward propagating eddies. Cyclonic (anticyclonic) eddies decrease (increase) the zonal sea level anomaly (SLA) slope and reduce (enhance) Kuroshio transport. Large transport anomalies of {$>$}10 Sv within O(10 days) are associated with the pairs of cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies. The observed Kuroshio transport was strongly correlated with the SLA slope (correlation 5 0.9). Analysis of SLA slope data at the entrance to Luzon Strait over the period 1992{\textendash}2013 reveals a seasonal cycle with a positive anomaly (i.e., an enhanced Kuroshio transport) in winter and spring and a negative anomaly in summer and fall. Eddy induced vorticity near the Kuroshio has a similar seasonal cycle, suggesting that seasonal variation of the Kuroshio transport near its origin is modulated by the seasonal variation of the impinging mesoscale eddies.},

  abstract = {Using a 19-year altimetric dataset, the mean properties and spatiotemporal variations of eddies in the Kuroshio recirculation region are examined. A total of 2 001 cyclonic tracks and 1 847 anticyclonic tracks were identified using a geometry-based eddy detection method. The mean radius was 57 km for cyclonic eddies and was 61 km for anticyclonic eddies, respectively, and the mean lifetime was about 10 weeks for both type eddies. There were asymmetric spatial distributions for eddy generation and eddy termination, which were domain-dependent. Mean eddy generation rates were 2.0 per week for cyclonic eddies and were 1.9 per week for anticyclonic eddies. Both type eddies tended to deform during their lifetime and had different propagation characteristics, which mainly propagated westward and southwestward with velocities 4.0{\textendash}9.9 cm/s, in the Kuroshio recirculation region. Further discussion illustrates that the eddy westward speed maybe influenced by the combined effect of vertical shear of horizontal currents and nonlinearity of eddy. To better understand the evolution of eddy tracks, a total of 134 long-lived tracks (lifetime {$\geq$}20 weeks) were examined. Comparison between short-span eddies (lifetime {$\geq$}4 weeks and {$<$}20 weeks) and long-lived eddies is also conducted and the result shows that the short-span and long-lived eddies have similar time evolution. Finally, eddy seasonal variations and interannual changes are discussed. Correlation analysis shows that eddy activity is sensitive to the wind stress curl and meridional gradient of sea surface temperature on interannual timescales. Besides, the strength and orientation of background flows also have impacts on the eddy genesis.},

Outputs take the form of (i) data files containing eddy properties, including position, radius, amplitude, and azimuthal (geostrophic) speed; and (ii) sequential image maps showing sea surface height maps with active eddy centers and tracks overlaid. The results given are from a demonstration in the Canary Basin region of the northeast Atlantic and are comparable with a published global eddy track database. Some discrepancies between the two datasets include eddy radius magnitude, and the distributions of eddy births and deaths. The discrepancies may be related to differences in the eddy identification methods, and also possibly to differences in the smoothing of the sea surface height maps.

  abstract = {Located at the center of the western North Pacific Subtropical Gyre, the Subtropical Countercurrent (STCC) is not only abundant in mesoscale eddies, but also exhibits prominent submesoscale eddy features. Output from a 1/308 high-resolution OGCM simulation and a gridded satellite altimetry product are analyzed to contrast the seasonal STCC variability in the mesoscale versus submesoscale ranges. Resolving the eddy scales of .150 km, the altimetry product reveals that the STCC eddy kinetic energy and rms vorticity have a seasonal maximum in May and April, respectively, a weak positive vorticity skewness without seasonal dependence, and an inverse (forward) kinetic energy cascade for wavelengths larger (shorter) than 250 km. In contrast, the submesoscale-resolving OGCM simulation detects that the STCC eddy kinetic energy and rms vorticity both appear in March, a large positive vorticity skewness with strong seasonality, and an intense inverse kinetic energy cascade whose short-wave cutoff migrates seasonally between the 35- and 100-km wavelengths. Using a 2.5-layer, reduced-gravity model with an embedded surface density gradient, the authors show that these differences are due to the seasonal evolution of two concurring baroclinic instabilities. Extracting its energy from the surface density gradient, the frontal instability has a growth time scale of O(7) days, a dominant wavelength of O(50) km, and is responsible for the surface-intensified submesoscale eddy signals. The interior baroclinic instability, on the other hand, extracts energy from the vertically sheared STCC system. It has a slow growth time scale of O(40) days, a dominant wavelength of O(250) km, and, together with the kinetic energy cascaded upscale from the submesoscales, determines the mesoscale eddy modulations.},

  abstract = {Being the extension of a wind-driven western boundary current, the Kuroshio Extension (KE) has long been recognized as a turbulent current system rich in large-amplitude meanders and energetic pinched-off eddies. An important feature emerging from recent satellite altimeter measurements and eddy-resolving ocean model simulations is that the KE system exhibits well-defined decadal modulations between a stable and an unstable dynamic state. Here the authors show that the decadally modulating KE dynamic state can be effectively defined by the sea surface height (SSH) anomalies in the 318{\textendash}368N, 1408{\textendash}1658E region. By utilizing the SSH-based KE index from 1977 to 2012, they demonstrate that the time-varying KE dynamic state can be predicted at lead times of up to ;6 yr. This long-term predictability rests on two dynamic processes: 1) the oceanic adjustment is via baroclinic Rossby waves that carry interior wind-forced anomalies westward into the KE region and 2) the low-frequency KE variability influences the extratropical storm tracks and surface wind stress curl field across the North Pacific basin. By shifting poleward (equatorward) the storm tracks and the large-scale wind stress curl pattern during its stable (unstable) dynamic state, the KE variability induces a delayed negative feedback that can enhance the predictable SSH variance on the decadal time scales.},

The top of the STMW follows a seasonal cycle, although observations reveal that it primarily varies in discrete steps associated with episodic wind events. The variations of the STMW bottom depth are tightly related to the sea surface height (SSH), reflecting mesoscale eddies and large-scale variations of the Kuroshio Extension and recirculation gyre systems. Using the observed relationship between SSH and STMW, gridded SSH products and in situ estimates from floats are used to construct weekly maps of STMW thickness, providing nonbiased estimates of STMW total volume, annual formation and erosion volumes, and seasonal and interannual variability for the past decade. Year-to-year variations are detected, particularly a significant decrease of STMW volume in 2007{\textendash}10 primarily attributable to a smaller volume formed. Variability of the heat content in the mode water region is dominated by the seasonal cycle and mesoscale eddies; there is only a weak link to STMW on interannual time scales, and no long-term trends in heat content and STMW thickness between 2002 and 2011 are detected. Weak lagged correlations among air{\textendash}sea fluxes, oceanic heat content, and STMW thickness are found when averaged over the northwestern Pacific recirculation gyre region.},

First, a new, global, 14{\textdegree} Mean Dynamic Topography, called the CNES-CLS13 MDT, has been calculated and is now available for use by the oceanographic community. By exploiting information from surface drifters and Argo floats, the new MDT resolves spatial scales beyond the resolution permitted by the recent Gravity and Ocean Circulation Experiment (GOCE) geoid models (125 km). Associated mean geostrophic speeds in strong currents are increased by 200\% on average compared to GOCE-based mean currents. In addition, for the first time, a two-level, monthly, empirical Ekman model that samples a spiral-like behavior is estimated. We show that combining both pieces of information leads to improved ocean currents compared to other existing observed products.},

Further, it is found that these life cycles can be accurately modeled in terms of the large-amplitude excursions of a stochastic process. These conclusions, which apply in the corresponding global-mean context, follow from the examination of ensemble-mean and standard deviation time series of normalized eddy amplitude from an automated eddy identification and tracking analysis of a nearly two decade{\textendash}merged satellite altimeter record of global sea surface height (SSH). The resulting series are found to have several striking and unexpected characteristics, including time-reversal symmetry and approximate self-similarity. Consistent results are obtained from a similar analysis of a 7-yr record of global SSH from a numerical ocean circulation model. The basic qualitative and quantitative statistical properties of these series can be remarkably well reproduced with an extremely simple stochastic model, in which the SSH increments between successive time points are random numbers, and the eddy life cycles are represented by excursions exceeding a given threshold. The stochastic model is found also to predict accurately the empirical autocorrelation structure of the underlying observed SSH field itself, when the autocorrelations are computed along long planetary (Rossby) wave characteristics.},

Linear stability analysis using vertical shear and stratification from the model reveals three dominant modes of instability in the LC: 1) a balanced interior mode with along-flow wavelengths of about 30{\textendash}45 km, phase velocities of 0.3 m s21, maximal growth rates of 1 day21, and surface-intensified but deepreaching amplitudes; 2) a balanced shallow mode with along-flow wavelengths of about 0.3{\textendash}1.5 km, phase velocities of 0.55 m s21, about 3 times larger growth rates, but amplitudes confined to the mixed layer (ML); and 3) an unbalanced symmetric mode with the largest growth rates, vanishing phase speeds, and along-flow structure, and very small cross-flow wavelengths, also confined to the ML. Both balanced modes are akin to baroclinic instability but operate at moderate-to-small Richardson numbers Ri with much larger growth rates as for the quasigeostrophic limit of Ri ) 1. The interior mode is found to be responsible for the instability of the LC during winter. Weak stratification and enhanced vertical shear due to local buoyancy loss and the advection of convective water masses from the interior result in small Ri within the LC and up to 3 times larger growth rates of the interior mode in March compared to summer and fall conditions. Both the shallow and the symmetric modes are not resolved by the model, but it is suggested that they might also play an important role for the instability in the LC and for lateral mixing.},

  abstract = {Simulated current velocity and long-term reanalysis wind data are used to investigate interannual variations in the bifurcation of the Pacific North Equatorial Current (NEC) after the 1976 climate regime shift. Wind stress curl anomaly (WSCA) in the region of 10 N{\textendash}15 N and 160 E{\textendash}170 E generates Rossby waves and affects the NEC bifurcation along the Philippine coast. From 1976 to 1992, following a regime shift to the positive Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) phase, PDO and El Nin{\textasciitilde}o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) match each other in strength and have a neutralized effect on the WSCA. From 1993 to 2009, WSCA matches PDO well, and its correlation with ENSO is lower. Using a linear regression model, we show that the influence of PDO has nearly 13 times weight over that of ENSO. Prior to the 1976 regime shift, WSCA is closely related to ENSO from 1961 to 1975, and it does not correlate significantly with PDO. Our analysis results show that Rossby waves are preferentially generated in either the negative PDO phase when the ENSO signal dominates, or in the positive PDO phase when the ENSO signal is overshadowed. In the phase when the positive PDO counteracts with the ENSO signal, neither ENSO nor PDO has a significant influence on Rossby wave generations through the WSCA.},

  abstract = {Mesoscale eddy effects on the subduction of North Pacific mode waters are investigated by comparing observations and ocean general circulation models where eddies are either parameterized or resolved. The eddy-resolving models produce results closer to observations than the noneddy-resolving model. There are large discrepancies in subduction patterns between eddy-resolving and noneddy-resolving models. In the noneddy-resolving model, subduction on a given isopycnal is limited to the cross point between the mixed layer depth (MLD) front and the outcrop line whereas in eddy-resolving models and observations, subduction takes place in a broader, zonally elongated band within the deep mixed layer region. Mesoscale eddies significantly enhance the total subduction rate, helping create remarkable peaks in the volume histogram that correspond to North Pacific subtropical mode water (STMW) and central mode water (CMW). Eddy-enhanced subduction preferentially occurs south of the winter mean outcrop. With an anticyclonic eddy to the west and a cyclonic eddy to the east, the outcrop line meanders south, and the thermocline/MLD shoals eastward. As eddies propagate westward, the MLD shoals, shielding the water of low potential vorticity from the atmosphere. The southward eddy flow then carries the subducted water mass into the thermocline. The eddy subduction processes revealed here have important implications for designing field observations and improving models.},

It is found that the depth-averaged Kuroshio between 200 and 700 m has increased over 15 cm s21 during the 2 year observational period and it is accompanied by the pronounced southward shift of the North Equatorial Current (NEC) bifurcation. Further analysis indicates that the Kuroshio's strengthening is confined to the upstream segment east of the Luzon Island while the Kuroshio decreased as it passed the Luzon Strait due to a dipole-like sea surface height (SSH) trend between 15 N and 23 N. It is demonstrated that the 2 year strengthening of the Kuroshio, as well as the dipole-like SSH trend can be adequately reproduced by a 1.5 layer nonlinear reduced gravity model, suggesting an important role of upper ocean response to low-frequency wind forcing in the western Pacific. Salinity at 500 m depth is also found to increase during the concurrent 2 years. This subthermocline salinity increase is a combined outcome of vertical (basin-scale isopycnal surface movement) and horizontal advections (i.e., strengthened Kuroshio) due to changes in the large-scale wind-driven ocean circulation.},

The results suggest the SLA signals from the tropical North Pacific propagate westward as baroclinic Rossby waves on an intra-seasonal time scale. Upon impinging the east coast of the Philippines, these Rossby wave signals transform into coastal trapped waves (CTWs), propagate clockwise along the coast of the Philippine Archipelago and enter into the eastern South China Sea (SCS) through the Sibutu Passage and Mindoro Strait. The SLA signals, however, cannot propagate anticlockwise and enter into the eastern SCS through the Luzon Strait. The intra-seasonal oceanic wave processes are clearly identified by the eddy-resolving model. The effect of along-shore wind forcing on the SLA signals appears insignificant when compared with the remote signals coming from the interior Pacific. While identified in the model simulation, future observations are needed to verify the intraseasonal CTWs encircling the Philippine Archipelago.},

  abstract = {The Southeast Pacific, which encompasses the coasts of Peru and Chile, is one of the world's most productive regions resulting principally from the upwelling of subsurface nutrient-rich waters. Over the satellite altimetry era, there have been numerous evidence that surface mesoscale eddies play an important role in the offshore transport of rich coastal waters, but it has been only recently that few observational/numerical studies have highlighted the importance of the subsurface eddies. The eddy field variability is explored using the results of a high-resolution model experiment from 1979 to 2012. The model results indicate an asymmetry of the surface and subsurface eddy fields. While surface-intensified cyclones are slightly more frequent than anticyclones, the subsurface field is dominated by anticyclones (IntrathermoclineEddies; ITEs), triggered by the instability of the subsurface Peru Chile undercurrent (PCUC). Composite maps are consistent with in situ observations. ITEs are associated with maximum vorticity around 150{\textendash}200 m depth, warmer and more saline core, characteristic of the equatorial subsurface water from the PCUC. We find that the variability of the ITEs is significantly correlated with the ENSO equatorial signal. During strong El Nin{\textasciitilde}o events (e.g., 1982; 1998), we find that while the PCUC transport increases, the volume of coastal waters transported by ITEs however decreases during those periods. We find that the relaxation of the isopycnals along the coast during El Nin{\textasciitilde}o events leads to weakened baroclinic instability and to a decrease of the ITEs transport.},

  abstract = {Abstract Eddy{\textendash}mean flow interactions along the Kuroshio Extension (KE) jet are investigated using a vorticity budget of a high-resolution ocean model simulation, averaged over a 13-yr period. The simulation explicitly resolves mesoscale eddies in the KE and is forced with air{\textendash}sea fluxes representing the years 1995{\textendash}2007. A mean-eddy decomposition in a jet-following coordinate system removes the variability of the jet path from the eddy components of velocity; thus, eddy kinetic energy in the jet reference frame is substantially lower than in geographic coordinates and exhibits a cross-jet asymmetry that is consistent with the baroclinic instability criterion of the long-term mean field. The vorticity budget is computed in both geographic (i.e., Eulerian) and jet reference frames; the jet frame budget reveals several patterns of eddy forcing that are largely attributed to varicose modes of variability. Eddies tend to diffuse the relative vorticity minima/maxima that flank the jet, removing momentum from the fast-moving jet core and reinforcing the quasi-permanent meridional meanders in the mean jet. A pattern associated with the vertical stretching of relative vorticity in eddies indicates a deceleration (acceleration) of the jet coincident with northward (southward) quasi-permanent meanders. Eddy relative vorticity advection outside of the eastward jet core is balanced mostly by vertical stretching of the mean flow, which through baroclinic adjustment helps to drive the flanking recirculation gyres. The jet frame vorticity budget presents a well-defined picture of eddy activity, illustrating along-jet variations in eddy{\textendash}mean flow interaction that may have implications for the jet's dynamics and cross-frontal tracer fluxes.},

  abstract = {Mesoscale eddies are ubiquitous features in the Southern Ocean, yet their phenomenology is not well quantified. To tackle this task, we use satellite observations of sea level anomalies and sea surface temperature (SST) as well as in situ temperature and salinity measurements from profiling floats. Over the period 1997{\textendash}2010, we identified over a million mesoscale eddy instances and were able to track about 105 of them over 1 month or more. The Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC), the boundary current systems, and the regions where they interact are hot spots of eddy presence, representing also the birth places and graveyards of most eddies. These hot spots contrast strongly to areas shallower than about 2000 m, where mesoscale eddies are essentially absent, likely due to topographical steering. Anticyclones tend to dominate the southern subtropical gyres, and cyclones the northern flank of the ACC. Major causes of regional polarity dominance are larger formation numbers and lifespans, with a contribution of differential propagation pathways of long-lived eddies. Areas of dominance of one polarity are generally congruent with the same polarity being longer-lived, bigger, of larger amplitude, and more intense. Eddies extend down to at least 2000 m. In the ACC, eddies show near surface temperature and salinity maxima, whereas eddies in the subtropical areas generally have deeper anomaly maxima, presumably inherited from their origin in the boundary currents. The temperature and salinity signatures of the average eddy suggest that their tracer anomalies are a result of both trapping in the eddy core and stirring.},

  abstract = {Three mechanisms for self-induced Ekman pumping in the interiors of mesoscale ocean eddies are investigated. The first arises from the surface stress that occurs because of differences between surface wind and ocean velocities, resulting in Ekman upwelling and downwelling in the cores of anticyclones and cyclones, respectively. The second mechanism arises from the interaction of the surface stress with the surface current vorticity gradient, resulting in dipoles of Ekman upwelling and downwelling. The third mechanism arises from eddy-induced spatial variability of sea surface temperature (SST), which generates a curl of the stress and therefore Ekman pumping in regions of crosswind SST gradients. The spatial structures and relative magnitudes of the three contributions to eddy-induced Ekman pumping are investigated by collocating satellitebased measurements of SST, geostrophic velocity, and surface winds to the interiors of eddies identified from their sea surface height signatures. On average, eddy-induced Ekman pumping velocities approach O(10) cm day21. SST-induced Ekman pumping is usually secondary to the two current-induced mechanisms for Ekman pumping. Notable exceptions are the midlatitude extensions of western boundary currents and the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, where SST gradients are strong and all three mechanisms for eddy-induced Ekman pumping are comparable in magnitude. Because the polarity of current-induced curl of the surface stress opposes that of the eddy, the associated Ekman pumping attenuates the eddies. The decay time scale of this attenuation is proportional to the vertical scale of the eddy and inversely proportional to the wind speed. For typical values of these parameters, the decay time scale is about 1.3 yr.},

  abstract = {Meanders and eddies are routinely observed in the Gulf Stream along the South Atlantic Bight. We analyze here the instability processes that lead to the formation of submesoscale eddies on the cyclonic side of the Gulf Stream at the exit of the Florida Straits using very high resolution realistic simulations. The positive relative vorticity and potential vorticity on the cyclonic side of the Gulf Stream are strongly intensified in the Straits due to topographic drag along the continental slope. The bottom drag amplifies the cyclonic shear by generating large positive vertical vorticity values within the sloped turbulent bottom boundary layer. Downstream from the Straits the current becomes unstable to horizontal shear instability, rolls up, and forms a street of submesoscale vortices. The vortices expand as they propagate northward along the shelf, where they can generate large vertical displacements and enhance cross-shelf exchanges.},

  abstract = {Large-scale baroclinic instability is investigated as a potential source of Rossby waves and large-scale variability in the ocean. This baroclinic instability is first reviewed in a 2.5-layer model. As already noticed by several authors, the instability arises in westward surface mean flow when the phase velocities of the two vertical modes are made equal by mean flow influence. This large-scale instability is stronger at low latitudes and thus is likely to happen in the westward return flow of the subtropical gyres. Further investigations with a continuous stratification quasigeostrophic model show that the instability is stronger where the mean flow projects negatively on the second baroclinic mode (imposing positive vertical modes at the surface). The linear stability calculation is then performed on Argo-derived mean flow along with mean stratification data. The results show that the unstable regions are situated at low latitudes in every oceanic basin, in western boundary currents, and in some part of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. The location of these unstable regions is well correlated with the region of negative projection of the mean flow on the second baroclinic mode. Given that the unstable mode growth times are generally smaller than 6 months at low latitudes, these unstable modes are likely to be observable in satellite altimetry. Therefore, results of the present article suggest that the large-scale instability is indeed a source of large-scale variability at low latitudes.},

The OAFlux data are also used for comparison. During the early heating period in the high-latitude ocean north of 308N, where a seasonal thermocline is formed above the deep mixed layer under strong surface heating, the MLD h is found to be scaled as h / {\dh}Lk{\TH}1=2, where L is the Monin-Obukhov length scale and k is the Ekman length scale. On the other hand, in the lowlatitude ocean south of 308N, where the preexisting MLD is shallow and surface heating is weak, h is found to be scaled by k. It is found that a large amount of heat flux across the MLD occurs, especially in the highlatitude ocean during the late heating period, in which h is small. It suggests the contribution by turbulent mixing across the MLD in addition to radiation penetration, and the eddy diffusivity in the high-latitude ocean is estimated as Kv \$ 102421023 m2 s21. The heat budget of the mixed layer reveals that the contribution from the ocean heat transport is much smaller than the surface heat flux in the high-latitude ocean except in the Kuroshio region, but it is sometimes comparable in the low-latitude ocean.},

  abstract = {We review the key processes controlling the net water circulation in shallow straits. The circulation is mainly barotropic, driven by the difference in mean sea level and tides on either side of the strait, the wind, the meandering of the currents in the adjoining seas, the bathymetry including the shape and width of the mouths and the presence of narrows, shoals, sills, islands, and lateral embayments. As the oceanography forcing can be non-synchronised on either side of the strait, the resulting net currents through the strait may appear chaotic. We apply these findings to the net circulation through the Bohai Strait in China using local wind, remote-sensing data of currents and sea level, and a hydrodynamic model. The net currents through the Bohai Strait were episodic. They were largest during winter storms when the wind generated a cyclonic coastal current in the northern Yellow Sea that flowed across the width of the Bohai Strait. Like the Luzon Strait, this current meandered and a branch of the current intruded into the northern Bohai Strait along the deeper channel. The wind set-up in the Bohai Sea and the wind-driven longshore current in the southern Bohai Sea generated a seaward flow through the southern Bohai Strait, somewhat like in Irbe Strait. As with the straits of the Seto Inland Sea, stagnation occurred in some embayments. As in the Torres Strait, the islands in the southern Bohai Strait retarded the net flow and increased the width of the outflow zone. These flows were also modulated at very long periods ({\textasciitilde}60 days) by long waves in the Yellow Sea, possibly generated by meandering of the Kuroshio Current that created an additional sea level slope through the strait. The transit time in the Bohai Strait was 60 and 10 days, respectively, during calm weather and winter storms. The residence time in the Bohai Sea was estimated to be about 1.68 years by the LOICZ model and 1.56 years by the hydrodynamic model, and the influence of the river runoff, including the Yellow River, was negligible.},

  abstract = {Last decade has witnessed extensive studies on mesoscale oceanic eddies in the Southern China Sea (SCS), however most of these studies are focused on the surface eddies, and three-dimensional features of eddies are not well known except some individual eddies. We apply a three-dimensional eddy detection scheme to a 9-year (2000{\textendash}2008) eddy-resolving numerical solution to acquire three-dimensional eddy data set in the SCS. The model solution is validated with observational data in terms of both seasonal and intra-seasonal scales. The statistical characteristics of eddies at the sea surface, such as eddy number, lifetime and radius, from the model are comparable with those derived from the satellite altimetry data. The vertical profiles of the physical features of eddies are exposed from the statistical analysis of the three-dimensional eddy data set. For examples, more cyclonic eddies (CEs) are generated than anticyclonic eddies (AEs) in the depth above about 350 m and an opposite trend is presented below 350 m. The lifetimes of CEs and AEs are statistically equal and no significant variation at different vertical levels. Eddies in the central SCS have the largest size than in other areas and their sizes decrease with the increase in water depth. The relative vorticity amplitude of eddies decreases with the increase in the depth. There are three different types of eddies: bowl-shaped with the largest size at the surface, lensshaped with the largest size in the middle and cone-shaped with the largest size at the bottom. Most of eddies are bowl-shaped eddies. The three types of eddies have different effects on the temperature and salinity profiles. Eddy genesis mechanisms are discussed and categorized into three types in the SCS: surface wind curl input, current interaction with the bottom topography and Kuroshio intrusion.},

Here, we present high-resolution regional climate modeling results, supported by observational analyses, demonstrating that meso-scale SST variability, largely confined in the Kuroshio-Oyashio confluence region (KOCR), can further exert a significant distant influence on winter rainfall variability along the U.S. Northern Pacific coast. The presence of meso-scale SST anomalies enhances the diabatic conversion of latent heat energy to transient eddy energy, intensifying winter cyclogenesis via moist baroclinic instability, which in turn leads to an equivalent barotropic downstream anticyclone anomaly with reduced rainfall. The finding points to the potential of improving forecasts of extratropical winter cyclones and storm systems and projections of their response to future climate change, which are known to have major social and economic impacts, by improving the representation of ocean eddy{\textendash}atmosphere interaction in forecast and climate models.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a new concept of urban shared-taxi services. The proposed system has a new organisational design and pricing scheme that aims to use the capacity in traditional taxi services in a more efficient way. In this system, a taxi acting in `sharing' mode offers lower prices to its clients, in exchange for them to accept sharing the vehicle with other persons who have compatible trips (time and space). The paper proposes and tests an agent-based simulation model in which a set of rules for space and time matching between a request of a client and the candidate shared taxis is identified. It considers that the client is only willing to accept a maximum deviation from his or her direct route and establishes an objective function for selecting the best candidate taxi. The function considers the minimum travel time combination of pickup and drop-off of all the pool of clients sharing each taxi while allowing to establish a policy of bonuses to competing taxis with certain number of occupants. An experiment for the city of Lisbon is presented with the objectives of testing the proposed simulation conceptual model and showing the potential of sharing taxis for improving mobility management in urban areas. Results show that the proposed system may lead to significant fare and travel time savings to passengers, while not jeopardising that much the taxi revenues.

  abstract = {The California Undercurrent (CUC) flows poleward mostly along the continental slope. It develops a narrow strip of large negative vertical vorticity through the turbulent boundary layer and bottom stress. In several downstream locations, the current separates, aided by topographic curvature and flow inertia, in particular near Point Sur Ridge, south of Monterey Bay. When this happens the high-vorticity strip undergoes rapid instability that appears to be mesoscale in ``eddy-resolving'' simulations but is substantially submesoscale with a finer computational grid. The negative relative vorticity in the CUC is larger than the background rotation f, and Ertel potential vorticity is negative. This instigates ageostrophic centrifugal instability. The submesoscale turbulence is partly unbalanced, has elevated local dissipation and mixing, and leads to dilution of the extreme vorticity values. Farther downstream, the submesoscale activity abates, and the remaining eddy motions exhibit an upscale organization into the mesoscale, resulting in long-lived coherent anticyclones in the depth range of 100{\textendash}500 m (previously called Cuddies) that move into the gyre interior in a generally southwestward direction. In addition to the energy and mixing effects of the postseparation instability, there is are significant local topographic form stress and bottom torque that retard the CUC and steer the mean current pathway.},

  abstract = {The coastal upwelling region of the California Current System (CalCS) is a well-known site of high productivity and lateral export of nutrients and organic matter, yet neither the magnitude nor the governing processes of this offshore transport are well quantified. Here we address this gap using a highresolution (5 km) coupled physical-biogeochemical numerical simulation (ROMS). The results reveal (i) that the offshore transport is a very substantial component of any material budget in this region, (ii) that it reaches more than 800 km into the offshore domain, and (iii) that this transport is largely controlled by mesoscale processes, involving filaments and westward propagating eddies. The process starts in the nearshore areas, where nutrient and organic matter-rich upwelled waters pushed offshore by Ekman transport are subducted at the sharp lateral density gradients of upwelling fronts and filaments located at \$25{\textendash}100 km from the coast. The filaments are very effective in transporting the subducted material further offshore until they form eddies at their tips at about 100{\textendash}200 km from the shore. The cyclonic eddies tend to trap the cold, nutrient, and organic matter-rich waters of the filaments, whereas the anticyclones formed nearby encapsulate the low nutrient and low organic matter waters around the filament. After their detachment, both types of eddies propagate further in offshore direction, with a speed similar to that of the first baroclinic mode Rossby waves, providing the key mechanism for long-range transport of nitrate and organic matter from the coast deep into the offshore environment.},

  abstract = {In the four major Eastern Boundary Upwelling Systems (EBUS), mesoscale eddies are known to modulate the biological productivity and transport near-coastal seawater properties toward the offshore ocean, however little is known about their main characteristics and vertical structure. This study combines 10 years of satellite-altimetry data and Argo float profiles of temperature and salinity, and our main goals are (i) to describe the main surface characteristics of long-lived eddies formed in each EBUS and their evolution, and (ii) to depict the main vertical structure of the eddy-types that coexist in these regions. A clustering analysis of the Argo profiles surfacing within the long-lived eddies of each EBUS allows us to determine the proportion of surface and subsurface-intensified eddies in each region, and to describe their vertical structure in terms of temperature, salinity and dynamic height anomalies. In the Peru-Chile Upwelling System, 55\% of the sampled anticyclonic eddies (AEs) have subsurface-intensified maximum temperature and salinity anomalies below the seasonal pycnocline, whereas 88\% of the cyclonic eddies (CEs) are surfaceintensified. In the California Upwelling System, only 30\% of the AEs are subsurface-intensified and all of the CEs show maximum anomalies above the pycnocline. In the Canary Upwelling System,  40\% of the AEs and  60\% of the CEs are subsurface-intensified with maximum anomalies extending down to 800 m depth. Finally, the Benguela Upwelling System tends to generate  40{\textendash}50\% of weak surface-intensified eddies and  50{\textendash}60\% of much stronger subsurface-intensified eddies with a clear geographical distribution. The mechanisms involved in the observed eddy vertical shapes are discussed.},

  abstract = {Regional sea level trend and variability in the Pacific Ocean have often been considered to be induced by low-frequency surface wind changes. This study demonstrates that significant sea level trend and variability can also be generated by eddy momentum flux forcing due to time-varying instability of the background oceanic circulation. Compared to the broad gyre-scale wind-forced variability, the eddy-forced sea level changes tend to have subgyre scales and, in the North Pacific Ocean, they are largely confined to the Kuroshio Extension region (308{\textendash}408N, 1408{\textendash}1758E) and the Subtropical Countercurrent (STCC) region (188{\textendash}288N, 1308{\textendash}1758E). Using a two-layer primitive equation model driven by the ECMWF wind stress data and the eddy momentum fluxes specified by the AVISO sea surface height anomaly data, the relative importance of the wind- and eddy-forced regional sea level trends in the past two decades is quantified. It is found that the increasing (decreasing) trend south (north) of the Kuroshio Extension is due to strengthening of the regional eddy forcing over the past two decades. On the other hand, the decreasing (increasing) sea level trend south (north) of the STCC is caused by the decadal weakening of the regional eddy momentum flux forcing. These decadal eddy momentum flux changes are caused by the background Kuroshio Extension and STCC changes in connection with the Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO) wind pattern shifting from a positive to a negative phase over the past two decades.},

Because the western Pacific warm pool, with sea surface temperatures {$>$}28{\textdegree}C, extends poleward of 17{\textdegree}N in the western North Pacific, the bifurcation and transport partitioning of the NEC into the Kuroshio and Mindanao Currents are likely to affect the temporal evolution of the warm pool through lateral advection.

This article synthesizes our current understandings of the NEC, especially those garnered through the recent Origins of the Kuroshio and Mindanao Current (OKMC) project.},

  abstract = {This study examines the climatological mean features of oceanic rings shed from the Kuroshio Extension (KE) jet and their interannual to decadal variability using satellite altimeter observations from October 1992 to December 2010. To objectively capture ring shedding from the KE jet, a new method that consists of the detection of the jet length changes and the tracking of a ring is proposed. Spatial distribution of the ring formations in the KE region indicates that cyclonic (cold-core) rings were most frequently formed in the upstream region between 143{\textdegree} and 147{\textdegree}E around the steady meander of the KE jet. In contrast, most of anticyclonic (warm-core) rings were formed in the downstream region west of the Shatsky Rise. These pinched-off rings in both the upstream and downstream regions generally propagated westward, but about two-thirds of the rings were reabsorbed by the jet. Nevertheless, about one-fourth of the meridional eddy heat transport at the latitude of the KE resulted from the rings that are not reabsorbed by the jet. The number of ring formations showed substantial interannual to decadal variability. In the upstream and downstream KE region, decadal and interannual variability was dominant, respectively. These ring formation fluctuations were negatively correlated with the strength of the KE jet. It is also revealed that the ring formation variations play an important role in sea surface temperature changes north of the KE jet.},

The associated regression (or coupling) coefficients for the wind stress divergence are consistently larger than those for the wind stress curl. To explore the underlying physics, the authors introduce a linearized model of the atmospheric boundary layer response to SST-induced modulations of boundary layer hydrostatic pressure and vertical mixing in the presence of advection by a background Ekman spiral. Model solutions are a strong function of the SST scale and background advection and recover observed characteristics. The coupling coefficients for wind stress divergence and curl are governed by distinct physics. Wind stress divergence results from either large-scale winds crossing the front or from a thermally direct, cross-frontal circulation. Wind stress curl, expected to be largest when winds are parallel to SST fronts, is reduced through geostrophic spindown and thereby yields weaker coupling coefficients.},

Zero lag correlations between PIES-measured acoustic travel times and satellite-measured sea surface height anomalies (SSHa), which are normally negative, have lower magnitude toward the west, suggesting the eddy-influence is weakened across the Kuroshio. The observational data reveal that impinging eddies lead to seesaw-like SSHa and pycnocline depth changes across the Kuroshio east of Taiwan, whereas analogous responses are not found in the Kuroshio northeast of Luzon. Anticyclones intensify sea surface and pycnocline slopes across the Kuroshio, while cyclones weaken these slopes, particularly east of Taiwan. During the 6 month period of overlap between the two PIES arrays, only one anticyclone affected the pycnocline depth first at the array northeast of Luzon and 21 days later in the downstream Kuroshio east of Taiwan.},

  abstract = {Satellite altimetry sea surface height measurements reveal high mesoscale eddy activity in the southeastern tropical Indian Ocean (SETIO). In this study, the characteristics of mesoscale eddies in the SETIO are investigated by analyzing 564 cyclonic eddy (CE) tracks and 695 anticyclonic eddy (AE) tracks identified from a new version of satellite altimetry data with a daily temporal resolution. The mean radius, lifespan, propagation speed, and distance of CEs (AEs) are 149 (153) km, 50 (46) days, 15.3 (16.6) cm s21, and 651 (648) km, respectively. Some significant differences exist in the eddy statistical characteristics between the new-version daily altimeter data and the former weekly data. Mean vertical structures of anomalous potential temperature, salinity, geostrophic current, as well as heat and salt transports of the composite eddies, are estimated by analyzing Argo profile data matched to altimeter-detected eddies. The composite analysis shows that eddy-induced ocean anomalies are mainly confined in the upper 300 dbar. In the eddy core, CE (AE) could induce a cooling (warming) of 28C between 60 and 180 dbar and maximum positive (negative) salinity anomalies of 0.1 (20.3) psu in the upper 50 (110) dbar. The meridional heat transport induced by the composite CE (AE) is southward (northward), whereas the salt transport of CE (AE) is northward (southward). Most of the meridional heat and salt transports are carried in the upper 300 dbar.},

  abstract = {The neon flying squid (Ommastrephes bartramii) is a short-lived opportunistic species widely distributed in subtropical and temperate waters in the North Pacific Ocean. The life cycle of O. bartramii from planktonic eggs to nektonic adults is closely linked to oceanographic conditions. The fluctuations in O. bartramii abundance and distribution tend to increase and widen continuously due to the heavy influences of ocean-climate events on various spatio-temporal scales. In this study, we reviewed the interaction between O. bartramii and oceanography variability in the North Pacific with respect to large-scale climatic-oceanic phenomena including El Ni{\~n}o, La Ni{\~n}a, Kuroshio, Oyashio and Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), as well as regional environmental variables such as sea surface temperature (SST), sea surface height (SSH), sea surface salinity (SSS), chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration, and plankton density. The population dynamics of O. bartramii is mediated mainly by meso- and large-scale climatic-oceanic events (e.g., Kuroshio and Oyashio Currents) rather than other local environmental conditions (e.g., SST and Chl-a concentration), because all of the oceanographic influences are imposed on the context of large-scale climate changes (e.g., PDO). An unstructured-grid finitevolume coastal ocean model coupled with an individual-based model is proposed to simulate relevant physical-biological oceanographic processes for identifying ocean-climate influence and predicting O. bartramii distribution and abundance in the North Pacific. Future research needs to be focused on improving the knowledge about early life history of O. bartramii and evaluating the relationship between marine physical environment and two separate passive drifting life stages of O. bartramii including free-floating eggs and planktonic paralarvae.},

Compared with the traditional Lorenz energy cycle, this framework provides a more accurate estimate of the background potential energy (PE) of the global oceans and the surface generation and interior fluxes of APE. Calculations of the global energy budget using 16 yr of ECCO2 output suggest that the adiabatic portion of the general circulation is maintained by a balance between the mean wind-driven upwelling that increases APE (10.27 TW) and time-fluctuating processes, including mesoscale eddies, which release APE (20.27 TW). The APE generated by surface buoyancy fluxes (0.46 TW) is comparable to the generation by the mean winds. The global rate of irreversible mixing (0.46 TW), which balances surface APE generation, is consistent with previous estimates of the diapycnal fluxes associated with maintaining deep stratification (see Munk and Wunsch) and a global diapycnal diffusivity of O(1 3 1024) m2 s21. However, the net contribution of diapycnal mixing to the total potential energy is negligible, which suggests that mixing, contrary to one current paradigm, does not place a global demand on kinetic energy dissipation. However, there are regions where mixing is significant, for example, between 3000 and 5000 m (in ECCO2), where mixing increases PE by 0.1 TW. The work provides a new framework for separating adiabatic{\textendash}diabatic fluxes and for monitoring the global rate of diapycnal mixing rate using measurable surface properties such as SST and heat flux.},

The vertical extent of the water mass anomalies in the warm (cold) STE is about 190 m (150 m), and its horizontal length scale is 22 {$\pm$} 7 km (18 {$\pm$} 10 km). According to their water mass properties, we speculate that the warm and cold STEs are generated in the North Pacific Subtropical and Subarctic Front region, respectively. The observed STEs may play an important role in modifying the intermediate-layer water properties in the STNWP, and this needs to be confirmed by more focused observations in the future.},

  abstract = {Oceanic eddies may cause local sea surface temperature (SST), height, and salinity anomalies in remote sensing (RS) images. Remote sensed SST imagery has proven to be an effective technique in oceanic eddy detection, because of its high temporal and spatial resolution. Various techniques have been used to identify eddies from SST images. However, mainly owing to the strong morphological variation of oceanic eddies, there is arguably no uniquely correct eddy detection method. A scheme of algorithm based on quasi-contour tracing and clustering of eddy detection from SST dataset is presented. The method does not impose fixed restrictions or limitations during the course of ``suspected'' eddy detection, and any eddy-like structures can be detected as ``suspected'' eddies. Then, ``true'' eddies can be identified based on the combination of intensity and spatial/temporal scale criteria. This approach has been applied to detect eddies in the East China Sea by using Operational SST \& Sea Ice Analysis (OSTIA) dataset. Experiments proved that oceanic eddies ranging in diameter from tens to hundreds of kilometers can be detected. Through investigation of the 2007{\textendash}2011 OSTIA daily SST dataset from the Kuroshio region in the East China Sea, we found that the most active regions for oceanic eddies are those along the Kuroshio path, northeast of Taiwan Island, the Yangtze Estuary and the Ryukyu Islands. About 86\% of the cyclonic eddies and 87\% of the anticyclonic eddies have the size of 50{\textendash}100 km in diameter. Only 25\% of the anticyclonic eddy and 26\% of the cyclonic eddy have the strength more than 0.4{\textdegree}C in the sea surface layer.},

In particular, they show that the recent surface quasigeostrophy (SQG) and interior and surface quasigeostrophy (ISQG) methods systematically lead to surface-intensified vortices, and those subsurface-intensified vortices are thus not correctly modeled. The authors then investigate the possibility of distinguishing between surface- and subsurface-intensified eddies from surface data only, using the sea surface height and the sea surface temperature available from satellite observations. A simple index, based on the ratio of the sea surface temperature anomaly and the sea level anomaly, is proposed. While the index is expected to give perfect results for isolated vortices, the authors show that in a complex environment, errors can be expected, in particular when strong currents exist in the vicinity of the vortex. The validity of the index is then analyzed using results from a realistic regional circulation model of the Peru{\textendash}Chile upwelling system, where both surface and subsurface eddies coexist. The authors find that errors are mostly associated with double-core eddies (aligned surface and subsurface cores) and that the index can be useful to determine the nature of mesoscale eddies (surface or subsurface intensified) from surface (satellite) observations. However, the errors reach 24\%, and some possible improvements of the index calculations are discussed.},

  abstract = {Insight into the global ocean energy cycle and its relationship to climate variability can be gained by examining the temporal variability of eddy{\textendash}mean flow interactions. A time-dependent version of the Lorenz energy diagram is formulated and applied to energetic ocean regions from a global, eddying state estimate. The total energy in each snapshot is partitioned into three components: energy in the mean flow, energy in eddies, and energy temporal anomaly residual, whose time mean is zero. These three terms represent, respectively, correlations between mean quantities, correlations between eddy quantities, and eddy-mean correlations. Eddy{\textendash}mean flow interactions involve energy exchange among these three components. The temporal coherence about energy exchange during eddy{\textendash}mean flow interactions is assessed. In the Kuroshio and Gulf Stream Extension regions, a suppression relation is manifested by a reduction in the baroclinic energy pathway to the eddy kinetic energy (EKE) reservoir following a strengthening of the barotropic energy pathway to EKE; the baroclinic pathway strengthens when the barotropic pathway weakens. In the subtropical gyre and Southern Ocean, a delay in energy transfer between different reservoirs occurs during baroclinic instability. The delay mechanism is identified using a quasigeostrophic, two-layer model; part of the potential energy in large-scale eddies, gained from the mean flow, cascades to smaller scales through eddy stirring before converting to EKE. The delay time is related to this forward cascade and scales linearly with the eddy turnover time. The relation between temporal variations in wind power input and eddy{\textendash}mean flow interactions is also assessed.},

The OFES-simulated sea level and upper ocean circulation changes show favorable comparisons with available tide gauge data and repeat hydrographic surveys along the 1378E meridian. An empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis reveals that the low-frequency NECC variability is dominated by two distinct modes. The first mode fluctuates interannually and shows strengthening and southward migration of the NECC concurrent with the development of El Nin{\textasciitilde}o events. Unlike the extratropical western Pacific Ocean circulation variability controlled by wind forcing west of the dateline, the interannual NECC variations are forced by equatorial wind forcing cumulative across the entire Pacific basin. The second mode of the NECC variability has an interdecadal timescale and is characterized by NECC's progressive weakening in strength, migrating poleward, and broadening in width over the past 50 years. These long-term changes in NECC are caused by the corresponding changes in the trade wind system that weakened and expanded poleward in the past half a century across the Pacific basin.},

The primary empirical orthogonal functions from most of the moorings are similar, decreasing monotonically with depth to a value near zero at the bottom. This contrasts with the standard barotropic (BT) and baroclinic (BC) modes, which have flow at the bottom. However, the structure is very similar to the first baroclinic (BC1) mode with zero horizontal flow at the bottom, as is appropriate over a rough or steeply sloping bottom. This mode captures a greater fraction of the observed variance than the standard flat bottom BC1 mode. Also, an analytical approximation of the first mode, obtained assuming exponential stratification, is as accurate as the numerically generated BC mode. This suggests a simple way to project surface velocities into the interior.},

It incorporates the advantages of the Okubo-Weiss (OW) method, and improves the algorithm robustness by using three different segmentation methods. First, by intersecting the OW mask with the positive and negative SLA masks, two separate initial eddy candidate segment masks for anticyclonic and cyclonic eddies are produced. Then the number of extrema inside the individual segments is calculated. If the number is two/greater than two, a histogram threshold/watershed method is applied to further divide the segments into subsegments. If the number is one, the segment is tested by predefined eddy criteria. If the criteria are not fulfilled, the eddy boundary is repeatedly shrunk by one pixel inward until the segment meets all the criteria. In this case it is saved as an eddy. A segment is discarded if the number of extrema is zero. The eddy detection results of this method, of the OW method and of a geometric eddy detection method are displayed and analyzed statistically. The seasonal cycle of eddy number from the three eddy detection methods is discussed in comparison to the EKE.},

  abstract = {Abstract A new objective algorithm for the characterization of the permanent pycnocline (OAC-P) in subtropical gyres is proposed. OAC-P is based on a pragmatic analysis of vertical density gradient features to identify the permanent pycnocline: OAC-P identifies the permanent pycnocline as the stratified layer found below surface mode waters. OAC-P provides the permanent pycnocline depth, unequivocally associated with a local maximum in the stratification, and top and bottom thicknesses, associated with upward and downward decreases in stratification, respectively. OAC-P uses half Gaussian curves as asymmetric nonlinear analytical models of the stratification peak. It is the first time that an algorithm is proposed to characterize objectively the permanent pycnocline for a region where handling the stronger stratification peak of the seasonal pycnocline is complex. A guideline for how to implement the OAC-P is given, with application to the North Atlantic Ocean Argo data as an example. OAC-P provides a detailed description of the mean structure of the North Atlantic subtropical permanent pycnocline. OAC-P detects a permanent pycnocline throughout the subtropical gyre north of the North Equatorial Current. The large-scale description of the permanent pycnocline depth structure as a classic bowl shape is captured however with much more detail. New regional information is provided. In particular, (i) there is only one region{\textemdash}the southern recirculation gyre of the Gulf Stream extension{\textemdash}where the permanent pycnocline is along an isopycnal surface and (ii) vertical asymmetries clearly discriminate one region from another.},

  abstract = {The mechanism responsible for the annual cycle of the flow through the straits of the Japan Sea is investigated using a two-layer model. Observations show maximum throughflow from summer to fall and minimum in winter, occurring synchronously at the three major straits: Tsushima, Tsugaru, and Soya Straits. This study finds the subpolar winds located to the north of Japan as the leading forcing agent, which first affects the Soya Strait rather than the Tsushima or Tsugaru Straits. The subpolar winds generate baroclinic Kelvin waves along the coastlines of the subpolar gyre, affect the sea surface height at the Soya Strait, and modify the flow through the strait. This causes barotropic adjustment to occur inside the Japan Sea and thus affect the flow at the Tsugaru and Tsushima Straits almost synchronously. The barotropic adjustment mechanism explains well why the observations show a similar annual cycle at the three straits. The annual cycle at the Tsugaru Strait is further shown to be weaker than that in the other two straits based on frictional balance around islands, that is, frictional stresses exerted around an island integrate to zero. In the Tsugaru Strait, the flows induced by the frictional integrals around the northern (Hokkaido) and southern (Honshu) islands are in opposite directions and tend to cancel out. Frictional balance also suggests that the annual cycle at the Tsugaru Strait is likely in phase with that at the Soya Strait because the length scale of the northern island is much shorter than that of the southern island.},

The observations captured the crest of the small meander that passed 1438E. Behind the meander crest, the meander showed the northward separation of the front from the meandering jet. It was suggested that the meander spread the low-density KE water to the north above the main pycnocline there. The OFES showed similar characteristics of small meanders. We focused on three major small meanders. In the upstream KE region west of 1438E, these meanders were subject to northeastward ageostrophic advection, by which the low-density KE water was carried to the north and their fronts moved away from the KE jet above the main pycnocline. This resulted in the KE water and the front extending to the west behind the crest of the downstream-propagating meanders. This feature was particularly obvious for the two cases of the meander and was consistent with the observations. The displaced front formed a shallow geostrophic jet to the north of the main KE jet, which induced geostrophic advection along the jet and advected the front further northward and downstream near the crest of the meandering front. The KE water spread by the small meanders then mostly evolved into warm core rings or warm streamers.},

  abstract = {We investigated the relationship between chlorophyll a (Chl-a) concentrations estimated from satellite observations and the activity of eddies in the Kuroshio Extension region. High (low) area-averaged Chl-a concentrations were frequently observed in the core of cyclonic (anticyclonic) eddies. Such relationships between Chl-a concentrations and eddy cores were not frequently observed in the southern part of the recirculation gyre, and advection of background meridional gradient of Chl-a by eddy-edge currents accounted for Chl-a spatial variability. Decadal-scale changes of Chl-a concentrations around the Kuroshio Extension were strongly affected by eddy activity and transport but not by large-scale near-surface isopycnal heaving. We also found that decadal changes of nutrient concentrations near the main stream could affect Chl-a concentrations in the southern part of the recirculation gyre via southward transport of eddies and mean flow.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong class="journal-contentHeaderColor"{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} The Genealogical Evolution Model (GEM) presented here is an efficient logical model used to track dynamic evolution of mesoscale eddies in the ocean. It can distinguish between different dynamic processes (e.g., merging and splitting) within a dynamic evolution pattern, which is difficult to accomplish using other tracking methods. To this end, the GEM first uses a two-dimensional (2-D) similarity vector (i.e., a pair of ratios of overlap area between two eddies to the area of each eddy) rather than a scalar to measure the similarity between eddies, which effectively solves the ``missing eddy'' problem (temporarily lost eddy in tracking). Second, for tracking when an eddy splits, the GEM uses both ``parent'' (the original eddy) and ``child'' (eddy split from parent) and the dynamic processes are described as the birth and death of different generations. Additionally, a new look-ahead approach with selection rules effectively simplifies computation and recording. All of the computational steps are linear and do not include iteration. Given the pixel number of the target region \emph{L}, the maximum number of eddies \emph{M}, the number \emph{N} of look-ahead time steps, and the total number of time steps \emph{T}, the total computer time is \emph{O}(\emph{L}\emph{M}(\emph{N} + 1)\emph{T}). The tracking of each eddy is very smooth because we require that the snapshots of each eddy on adjacent days overlap one another. {$<$}br{$><$}br{$>$} Although eddy splitting or merging is ubiquitous in the ocean, they have different geographic distributions in the North Pacific Ocean. Both the merging and splitting rates of the eddies are high, especially at the western boundary, in currents and in ``eddy deserts''. The GEM is useful not only for satellite-based observational data, but also for numerical simulation outputs. It is potentially useful for studying dynamic processes in other related fields, e.g., the dynamics of cyclones in meteorology.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Life in the ocean relies on the photosynthetic production of phytoplankton, which is influenced by the availability of light and nutrients that are modulated by a host of physical processes. Submesoscale processes are particularly relevant to phytoplankton productivity because the timescales on which they act are similar to those of phytoplankton growth. Their dynamics are associated with strong vorticity and strain rates that occur on lateral scales of 0.1{\textendash}10 km. They can support vertical velocities as large as 100 m d-1 and play a crucial role in transporting nutrients into the sunlit ocean for phytoplankton production. In regimes with deep surface mixed layers, submesoscale instabilities can cause stratification within days, thereby increasing light exposure for phytoplankton trapped close to the surface. These instabilities help to create and maintain localized environments that favor the growth of phytoplankton, contribute to productivity, and cause enormous heterogeneity in the abundance of phytoplankton, which has implications for interactions within the ecosystem.},

  abstract = {The Kuroshio Extension (KE) fluctuates between its different dynamic regimes on (quasi) decadal time scales. In its stable (unstable) regime, the KE jet is strengthened (weakened) and less (more) meandering. The present study investigates wintertime mesoscale atmospheric structures modulated under the changing KE regimes, as revealed in high-resolution satellite data and data from a particular atmospheric reanalysis (ERAInterim). In the unstable KE regime, a positive anomaly in sea surface temperature (SST) to the north of the climatological KE jet accompanies positive anomalies in upward heat fluxes from the ocean, surface wind convergence, and cloudiness. As revealed in the atmospheric reanalysis, these positive anomalies coincide with local lowering of sea level pressure, weaker vertical wind shear, warming and thickening of the marine atmospheric boundary layer (MABL), anomalous ascent, and convective precipitation. In the stable KE regime, by contrast, the corresponding imprints of sharp SST gradients across the KE and Oyashio fronts on the wintertime MABL are separated more distinctly, and so are the surface baroclinic zones along those two SST fronts. In the ERA-Interim data, such mesoscale imprints of the KE variability as above are not well represented in a period during which the resolution of SST data prescribed is relatively low. The present study thus elucidates the importance of high-resolution SST data prescribed for atmospheric reanalysis in representing modulations of the MABL structure and air{\textendash}sea fluxes by the variability of oceanic fronts and/or jets, including the modulations occurring with the changing KE regimes through the hydrostatic pressure adjustment and vertical mixing mechanisms.},

To gain an understanding of ocean eddies from the large volume of data produced by simulations, visualizing just the distribution of eddies at each time step is insufficient; timevariations in eddy events and phenomena must also be considered. However, existing methods cannot accurately detect and track eddy events such as amalgamation and bifurcation. In this study, we propose a new approach for eddy detection, tracking, and event visualization based on an eddy classification system. The proposed method detects streams and currents in addition to eddies, and it classifies detected eddies into several categories using the additional stream and current information. By tracking how the classified eddies vary over time, it is possible to detect events such as eddy amalgamation and bifurcation as well as the interaction between eddies and ocean currents. We visualize the detected eddies and events in a time series of images (or animation), enabling us to gain an intuitive understanding of a region of interest hidden in a high-resolution data set.},

Specifically, the authors utilize the 1/308, submesoscale-resolving, OFES model output and subject it to the SWOT simulator that generates the along-swath SSH data with expected measurement errors. Focusing on the Kuroshio Extension region in the North Pacific where regional Rossby numbers range from 0.22 to 0.32, this study finds that the eSQG dynamics constitute an effective framework for reconstructing the 3D upper-ocean circulation field. Using the modeled SSH data as input, the eSQG-reconstructed relative vorticity z and w fields are found to reach a correlation of 0.7{\textendash}0.9 and 0.6{\textendash}0.7, respectively, in the 1000-m upper ocean when compared to the original model output. Degradation due to the SWOT sampling and measurement errors in the input SSH data for the z and w reconstructions is found to be moderate, 5\%{\textendash}25\% for the 3D z field and 15\%{\textendash}35\% for the 3D w field. There exists a tendency for this degradation ratio to decrease in regions where the regional eddy variability (or Rossby number) increases.},

When the index is positive, the KE is in the stable state, strengthened and shifted northward, with lower eddy kinetic energy, and the Kuroshio{\textendash}Oyashio Extension (KOE) region is anomalously warm. The reverse holds when the index is negative. Regression analysis shows that there is a coherent atmospheric response to the decadal KE fluctuations between October and January. The KOE warming generates an upward surface heat flux that leads to local ascending motions and a northeastward shift of the zones of maximum baroclinicity, eddy heat and moisture fluxes, and the storm track. The atmospheric response consists of an equivalent barotropic large-scale signal, with a downstream high and a low over the Arctic. The heating and transient eddy anomalies excite stationary Rossby waves that propagate the signal poleward and eastward. There is a warming typically exceeding 0.6 K at 900 hPa over eastern Asia and western United States, which reduces the snow cover by 4\%{\textendash}6\%. One month later, in November{\textendash}February, a high appears over northwestern Europe, and the hemispheric teleconnection bears some similarity with the Arctic Oscillation. Composite analysis shows that the atmospheric response primarily occurs during the stable state of the KE, while no evidence of a significant large-scale atmospheric response is found in the unstable state. Arguments are given to explain this strong asymmetry.},

The observed flows are more energetic at the surface, but the shape of the kinetic energy spectra is independent of depth. These characteristics resemble predictions of isotropic interior quasigeostrophic turbulence. The ratio of across-track to along-track kinetic energy spectra, however, significantly departs from the expectation of isotropic interior quasigeostrophic turbulence. The inconsistency is dramatic at scales smaller than 40 km. A Helmholtz decomposition of the ADCP spectra and analyses of synthetic and numerical model data show that horizontally divergent, ageostrophic flows account for the discrepancy between the observed spectra and predictions of isotropic interior quasigeostrophic turbulence. In Drake Passage, ageostrophic motions appear to be dominated by inertia{\textendash}gravity waves and account for about half of the near-surface kinetic energy at scales between 10 and 40 km.

Coherent mesoscale features (referred to here as eddies) in the tropical northeastern Atlantic Ocean (between 12{\textendash}22{\textdegree}\,N and 15{\textendash}26{\textdegree}\,W) are examined and characterized. The eddies' surface signatures are investigated using 19 years of satellite-derived sea level anomaly (SLA) data. Two automated detection methods are applied, the geometrical method based on closed streamlines around eddy cores, and the Okubo{\textendash}Wei{\ss} method based on the relation between vorticity and strain. Both methods give similar results. Mean eddy surface signatures of SLA, sea surface temperature (SST) and sea surface salinity (SSS) anomalies are obtained from composites of all snapshots around identified eddy cores. Anticyclones/cyclones are identified by an elevation/depression of SLA and enhanced/reduced SST and SSS in their cores. However, about 20\,\% of all anticyclonically rotating eddies show reduced SST and reduced SSS instead. These kind of eddies are classified as anticyclonic mode-water eddies (ACMEs). About 146\,{$\pm$}\,4 eddies per year with a minimum lifetime of 7 days are identified (52\,\% cyclones, 39\,\% anticyclones, 9\,\% ACMEs) with rather similar mean radii of about 56\,{$\pm$}\,12\,km. Based on concurrent in situ temperature and salinity profiles (from Argo float, shipboard, and mooring data) taken inside of eddies, distinct mean vertical structures of the three eddy types are determined. Most eddies are generated preferentially in boreal summer and along the West African coast at three distinct coastal headland regions and carry South Atlantic Central Water supplied by the northward flow within the Mauretanian coastal current system. Westward eddy propagation (on average about 3.00\,{$\pm$}\,2.15\,km\,d-1) is confined to distinct zonal corridors with a small meridional deflection dependent on the eddy type (anticyclones {\textendash} equatorward, cyclones {\textendash} poleward, ACMEs {\textendash} no deflection). Heat and salt fluxes out of the coastal region and across the Cape Verde Frontal Zone, which separates the shadow zone from the ventilated subtropical gyre, are calculated.},

Considering just the rotation direction of the surface flow field, eddies are categorized into cyclonic (CEs) and anticyclonic eddies. If vertical stratification is considered additionally, a refinement can be made by distinguishing between anticyclonic (AEs) and anticyclonic modewater eddies (ACMEs). ACMEs are characterized by a subsurface mode of rather homogenous water located between upward and downward displaced isopycnals. Eddies can be identified and classified from space by investigating the sea surface parameters: Sea level anomaly (SLA), sea surface temperature (SST) and sea surface salinity (SSS). AEs/CEs are associated with an elevation/depression of SLA and enhanced/reduced SST and SSS in their cores. However, 20\% of all anticyclonic eddies are associated with reduced SST and SSS instead and are identified as ACMEs. In the area of interest, about 146{$\pm$}4 eddies per year with a minimum lifetime of 7 days are identified (52\% CEs, 39\% AEs, 9\% ACMEs). All observed eddies are isolated and serve as transport agents, exporting water from the coast into the open ocean. In CEs and ACMEs low oxygen cores are identified and related to enhanced primary production at the surface and an associated elevated respiration rates within the isolated eddy cores. It could be observed that the phase speed of NIWs and the speed of the mean eddy flow are of similar magnitude. Therefore, critical layer formation is expected and mixing is likely to occur close to the euphotic zone at the eddy periphery. These processes describe one mechanism that support an upward nutrient flux towards the euphotic zone and the coexistence with a highly isolated eddy core. The analysis shows that anomalous environments associated with eddy cores occur more frequently than previously expected.},

  abstract = {The formation of a subsurface anticyclonic eddy in the Peru-Chile Undercurrent (PCUC) in January and February 2013 is investigated using a multiplatform four-dimensional observational approach. Research vessel, multiple glider, and mooring-based measurements were conducted in the Peruvian upwelling regime near 12830'S. The data set consists of {$>$}10,000 glider profiles and repeated vessel-based hydrography and velocity transects. It allows a detailed description of the eddy formation and its impact on the near-coastal salinity, oxygen, and nutrient distributions. In early January, a strong PCUC with maximum poleward velocities of \$0.25 m/s at 100{\textendash}200 m depth was observed. Starting on 20 January, a subsurface anticyclonic eddy developed in the PCUC downstream of a topographic bend, suggesting flow separation as the eddy formation mechanism. The eddy core waters exhibited oxygen concentration of {$<$}1 lmol/kg, an elevated nitrogen deficit of \$17 lmol/L, and potential vorticity close to zero, which seemed to originate from the bottom boundary layer of the continental slope. The eddy-induced across-shelf velocities resulted in an elevated exchange of water masses between the upper continental slope and the open ocean. Small-scale salinity and oxygen structures were formed by along-isopycnal stirring, and indications of eddy-driven oxygen ventilation of the upper oxygen minimum zone were observed. It is concluded that mesoscale stirring of solutes and the offshore transport of eddy core properties could provide an important coastal open ocean exchange mechanism with potentially large implications for nutrient budgets and biogeochemical cycling in the oxygen minimum zone off Peru.},

  abstract = {The Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service (CMEMS) Ocean State Report (OSR) provides an annual report of the state of the global ocean and European regional seas for policy and decision-makers with the additional aim of increasing general public awareness about the status of, and changes in, the marine environment. The CMEMS OSR draws on expert analysis and provides a 3-D view (through reanalysis systems), a view from above (through remotesensing data) and a direct view of the interior (through in situ measurements) of the global ocean and the European regional seas. The report is based on the unique CMEMS monitoring capabilities of the blue (hydrography, currents), white (sea ice) and green (e.g. Chlorophyll) marine environment. This first issue of the CMEMS OSR provides guidance on Essential Variables, large-scale changes and specific events related to the physical ocean state over the period 1993{\textendash}2015. Principal findings of this first CMEMS OSR show a significant increase in global and regional sea levels, thermosteric expansion, ocean heat content, sea surface temperature and Antarctic sea ice extent and conversely a decrease in Arctic sea ice extent during the 1993{\textendash}2015 period. During the year 2015 exceptionally strong large-scale changes were monitored such as, for example, a strong El Ni{\~n}o Southern Oscillation, a high frequency of extreme storms and sea level events in specific regions in addition to areas of high sea level and harmful algae blooms. At the same time, some areas in the Arctic Ocean experienced exceptionally low sea ice extent and temperatures below average were observed in the North Atlantic Ocean.},

  abstract = {南海蕴含着丰富的中尺度涡旋活动，开展南海中尺度涡研究对理解南海的物 质输运与机械能平衡问题具有重要意义。为探究南海中尺度涡的空间结构与生命 过程，课题组于 2013 年 10 月至 2014 年 6 月期间，在南海北部针对中尺度涡开 展了一系列综合性现场观测，称之为``南海中尺度涡观测实验''（简称 S-MEE）。 基于 S-MEE 实验所获得的大量现场资料，并结合其它观测数据和数值模式数据， 本文对南海北部中尺度涡的三维结构与输运作用、生成和消亡机制以及其它相关 问题展开了较为系统的研究。 基于 S-MEE 实验的两个潜标阵获得的观测数据，作者运用合成的方法刻画 了南海北部一个中尺度涡对（暖涡和冷涡）的全水深三维结构。发现南海北部中 尺度涡是全水深的海洋现象，它的信号能够从海表一直延伸到两三千米的海底； 在海底处中尺度涡的流速仍可达到 5.0 cm/s，因而对深海的物质输运具有潜在的 重要作用。同时发现，中尺度涡的三维结构在垂向上呈现显著的倾斜，从表层至 海底中尺度涡的轴心逐渐往西南方向倾斜，最大倾斜距离达到 150 公里。基于相 关理论分析作者初步认为，``地形 Beta 效应''对中尺度涡迁移的``牵引''作用 是造成南海北部中尺度涡垂向倾斜的主要原因。 基于南海北部中尺度涡的空间结构，作者定量评估了它们对水体的输运作 用。潜标阵观测和卫星观测表明，台湾西南海域的部分暖涡源自于``黑潮流套'' 的脱落，作者建议将该类暖涡命名为``黑潮流套涡旋''。结合``黑潮流套涡旋'' 的温盐结构和高度计的统计结果，作者估算了由于此类涡旋的脱落而引起的等效 水体输运。估算结果为 0.46 Sv，约占吕宋海峡上层平均水通量的 10\%{\textendash}17\%。同 时，作者还结合南海北部中尺度涡的垂向结构和涡旋统计信息，估算了由于中尺 度涡的非线性效应所造成的``拉格朗日''水体输运。南海北部中尺度涡在往西南 方向的迁移过程中，其所携带的水体能够造成 0.77 Sv 的南向输运，约占``南海 贯通流''净通量的 27.5\%。这些结果表明，南海北部中尺度涡在海盆间的物质交 换和海盆内的径向物质输运中均扮演着重要的角色 基于吕宋海峡内四套潜标的流速资料，作者阐明了海峡内流场两种不同周期 季节内震荡的产生机制。分析结果表明，海峡内流场的准 60 天周期震荡与太平 洋西传的中尺度涡对吕宋海峡以东黑潮的撞击有关，而 10{\textendash}30 天周期震荡则可能 由海峡内风场的季节内变化直接强迫产生。同时，作者探究了台湾西南海域冷涡 的生成机制，以及它对``黑潮流套涡旋''脱落的影响。``黑潮流套''进入南海后， 其北侧分支由于正压不稳定和满足``位涡守恒约束''，在台湾西南海域会生成一 个冷涡；该冷涡生成后往南迁移并对``黑潮流套''进行挤压，最终造成了``黑潮 流套涡旋'' 的脱落。该结果自洽地解释了为何在台湾西南海域暖涡和冷涡往往 以涡对的形式相伴而生。 最后，作者还基于对一个中尺度涡案例的生命过程的观测，通过分析中尺度 涡的能量收支方程，探究了它的主要消亡机制。结果表明，在中尺度涡边缘生成 了强烈的亚中尺度过程，而将能量正级串给亚中尺度过程构成了中尺度涡的主要 消亡机制。除此之外，底摩擦做功和垂向混合也造成了中尺度涡部分能量的耗散， 但总体而言二者对中尺度涡消亡的作用相对次之。尽管只是关于中尺度涡消亡机 制的个例研究，但该研究从现场观测的角度为``大洋中尺度涡如何消亡''难题开 辟了一条重要的途径。根据中尺度涡的能量耗散，估算了亚中尺度过程所对应的 水平涡动粘性系数 Ah，其量值为 75{\textendash}110 m2s-1，这为南海中尺度分辨率（{\textasciitilde}10 km） 的海洋模式关于如何选取 Ah 并设计合理的参数化方案提供了重要的参考。},

  abstract = {The mean vertical structure and transport properties of mesoscale eddies are investigated in the North Atlantic subtropical gyre by combining historical records of Argo temperature/salinity profiles and satellite sea level anomaly data in the framework of the eddy tracking technique. The study area is characterized by a low eddy kinetic energy and sea surface salinity maximum. Although eddies have a relatively weak signal at surface (amplitudes around 3{\textendash}7 cm), the eddy composites reveal a clear deep signal that penetrates down to at least 1200 m depth. The analysis also reveals that the vertical structure of the eddy composites is strongly affected by the background stratification. The horizontal patterns of temperature/salinity anomalies can be reconstructed by a linear combination of a monopole, related to the elevation/depression of the isopycnals in the eddy core, and a dipole, associated with the horizontal advection of the background gradient by the eddy rotation. A common feature of all the eddy composites reconstructed is the phase coherence between the eddy temperature/salinity and velocity anomalies in the upper \$300 m layer, resulting in the transient eddy transports of heat and salt. As an application, a box model of the near-surface layer is used to estimate the role of mesoscale eddies in maintaining a quasi-steady state distribution of salinity in the North Atlantic subtropical salinity maximum. The results show that mesoscale eddies are able to provide between 4 and 21\% of the salt flux out of the area required to compensate for the local excess of evaporation over precipitation.},

  abstract = {An interdisciplinary survey of a subtropical intrathermocline eddy was conducted within the Canary Eddy Corridor in September 2014. The anatomy of the eddy is investigated using near submesoscale fine resolution two-dimensional data and coarser resolution three-dimensional data. The eddy was four months old, with a vertical extension of 500m and 46km radius. It may be viewed as a propagating negative anomaly of potential vorticity (PV), 95\% below ambient PV. We observed two cores of low PV, one in the upper layers centered at 85m, and another broader anomaly located between 175m and the maximum sampled depth in the three-dimensional dataset (325m). The upper core was where the maximum absolute values of normalized relative vorticity (or Rossby number), |Ro| =0.6, and azimuthal velocity, U=0.5ms-1, were reached and was defined as the eddy dynamical core. The typical biconvex isopleth shape for intrathermocline eddies induces a decrease of static stability, which causes the low PV of the upper core. The deeper low PV core was related to the occurrence of a pycnostad layer of subtropical mode water that was embedded within the eddy. The eddy core, of 30km radius, was in near solid body rotation with period of {\textasciitilde}4 days. It was encircled by a thin outer ring that was rotating more slowly. The kinetic energy (KE) content exceeded that of available potential energy (APE), KE/APE=1.58; this was associated with a low aspect ratio and a relatively intense rate of spin as indicated by the relatively high value of Ro. Inferred available heat and salt content anomalies were AHA=2.9{\texttimes}1018 J and ASA=14.3{\texttimes}1010kg, respectively. The eddy AHA and ASA contents per unit volume largely exceed those corresponding to Pacific Ocean intrathermocline eddies. This suggests that intrathermocline eddies may play a significant role in the zonal conduit of heat and salt along the Canary Eddy Corridor.},

The amplitude and dominant periods of SSH variability differ regionally. Large-amplitude variability is found along the west coast of Sumatra, in a zonal band across the BoB centered along 58N, east of Sri Lanka, and in the northwestern BoB, respectively. Along the Sumatran west coast, SSH variability peaks at 30{\textendash}60, 90, and 180 days. Along 58N and east of Sri Lanka, the 30{\textendash}60 day variability is dominant. Sensitivity experiments using a nonlinear version of the 11=2 layer model forced by realistic winds reproduce the observed patterns of intraseasonal variability in the southern BoB. At 30{\textendash}60 days, the solutions show that eddies (nonlinear Rossby waves) propagating from the east, rather than local wind forcing, account for most of the variance east of Sri Lanka; furthermore, they demonstrate that the variance is significantly enhanced by the nonlinear transfer of 90{\textendash}120 day energy into the intraseasonal band of 30{\textendash}60 days. The LCS solutions show that the first two baroclinic modes explain most of the SSH variance at 90{\textendash}180 days. The second baroclinic mode dominates the SSH variance at 180 days, a consequence of basin resonance and strong wind forcing.},

Its variability is of interest due to its profound impact on regional climate, ecosystems, biological processes, and fisheries. This study examines the influence of the El Ni{\~n}o{\textendash}Southern Oscillation (ENSO), a basin-scale climatic mode, on the interannual variability of this regional eddy pair using satellite observational data and historical hydrographic measurements. Over the last three decades, the eddy pair strengthened in 1994 and 2002, and weakened in 2006, 2007, and 2008. It was absent in 1988, 1995, 1998, and 2010, coinciding with strong El Nino-to-La Nina transitions. Composite analyses showed that the strong transition events of ENSO led to radical changes in the summer monsoon, through the forcing of a unique sea surface temperature anomaly structure over the tropical Indo-Pacific basin. With weaker zonal wind, a more northward wind direction, and the disappearance of a pair of positive and negative wind stress curls, the eastward current jet turns northward along the Vietnam coast and the eddy pair disappears.},

The threedimensional structures and transports of mesoscale eddies in this region are comprehensively investigated by combined use of satellite data and Argo profiles. With the allocation of Argo profiles inside detected eddies, the spatial variations of structures of eddy temperature and salinity anomalies are analyzed. The results show that eddies predominantly have subsurface (near-surface) intensified temperature and salinity anomalies south (north) of the KE jet, which is related to different background stratifications between these regions. A new method based on eddy trajectories and the inferred three-dimensional eddy structures is proposed to estimate heat and salt transports by eddy movements in a Lagrangian framework. Spatial distributions of eddy transports are presented over the vicinity of the KE for the first time. The magnitude of eddy-induced meridional heat (freshwater volume) transport is on the order of 0.01 PW (103 m3/s). The eddy heat transport divergence results in an oceanic heat loss south and heat gain north of the KE, thereby reinforcing and counteracting the oceanic heat loss from air-sea fluxes south and north of the KE jet, respectively.

  abstract = {黑潮延伸区海域(25oN-45oN和130oE-180oE)是世界上最活跃的海域之一。中尺度涡分别从黑潮延伸体的南边和北边剥落,与当地复杂的海洋峰以及来自副热带和副极地海域的中尺度涡相互作用。黑潮延伸区海域的这些中尺度涡促进了北太平洋海域热量和盐度的纬向传输,影响着黑潮路径的变异、局部海域的水文环境、水团的形成、海洋生态、渔业甚至暴风雨的路径等。因此,系统地开展关于黑潮延伸区海域中尺度涡的研究不仅对理解西北太平洋中物质和能量的平衡问题有着重要意义,也对其他西边界流海域中尺度现象的研究有启示作用。本文基于卫星遥感数据和Argo浮标数据,对黑潮延伸区海域中尺度涡的统计属性、传播特征、三维结构、输运作用以及日本南部四国环流涡旋(SRG)海域附近的一种特殊类型的中尺度涡{\textemdash}{\textemdash}模态水中尺度涡(ACME)的属性和产生机制等问题进行了系统的研究,论文的主要研究工作和成果如下:(1)在黑潮延伸区海域比较了两种涡旋自动提取算法{\textemdash}{\textemdash}FAG算法和NEN算法。证实了FAG算法能提取到更多的寿命较长的涡旋,有利于涡旋的自动跟踪;并基于FAG算法制作了黑潮延伸区海域涡旋的数据集。(2)联合海表面高度异常(SLA),海表面温度(SST)和海表面盐度(SSS)卫星数据,提取了涡旋的海表面信号,并发现相对于涡旋的SLA信号,涡旋的SST和SSS信号向西偏移。而且,这种不对称性,涡旋SST数据相较于SSS数据更明显,反气旋涡相较于气旋涡更明显,黑潮延伸区以南的涡旋相较于以北的涡旋更明显。(3)联合现场实测数据,分析了涡旋的垂直结构和空间变异。发现黑潮延伸区以南(以北)海域的涡旋在水下(近海表面)深度上有强化的温度和盐度异常。(4)在拉格朗日坐标系下,提出了一种基于涡旋运动轨迹和三维结构的计算由涡旋运动造成的热量和盐度传输的新方法,有效抑制了Argo浮标采样数不足的问题。研究区内涡旋的纬向热量(等价淡水)输送大约为0.01 PW(103 m3/s)。涡旋热量输送的散度在黑潮延伸体以南和以北的海域分别造成海洋热量的损失和获取,表明有穿过黑潮延伸体向北的热量输送。(5)基于卫星高度计和Argo浮标数据,本文发现日本南部SRG附近反气旋涡在海表层(海表面到水下100 m的深度)表现出明显的冷信号,而这与常见的暖核反气旋涡的规律不符。通过分析该海域反气旋涡的垂直温盐结构、核内的海表面温度异常(SSTA)的统计分布以及SSTA与涡旋幅度的关系,证实了该海域附近的反气旋涡实际上以ACME为主。反气旋涡的融合过程以及冬天海洋的对流活动是促进ACME形成的两个重要因素。在寒冷的季节,混合层的深度在ACME中相较于在气旋涡和涡旋外的水体内要深,意味着ACME为北太平洋副热带模态水的形成创造了良好的环境条件。局地特殊的地形和特定的水文环境(SRG的存在)共同帮助吸引反气旋涡,使得反气旋涡融合的频率更高,模态水中尺度涡的产生也更有效。},

  abstract = {Seven years of data from the NOAA Kuroshio Extension Observatory (KEO) surface mooring, located in the North Pacific Ocean carbon sink region, were used to evaluate drivers of mixed-layer carbon cycling. A time-dependent mass balance approach relying on two carbon tracers was used to diagnostically evaluate how surface ocean processes influence mixed-layer carbon concentrations over the annual cycle. Results indicate that the annual physical carbon input is predominantly balanced by biological carbon uptake during the intense spring bloom. Net annual gas exchange that adds carbon to the mixed layer and the opposing influence of net precipitation that dilutes carbon concentrations make up smaller contributions to the annual mixed-layer carbon budget. Decomposing the biological term into annual net community production (aNCP) and calcium carbonate production (aCaCO3) yields 7 {$\pm$} 3 mol C m-2 yr-1 aNCP and 0.5 {$\pm$} 0.3 mol C m-2 yr-1 aCaCO3, giving an annually integrated particulate inorganic carbon to particulate organic carbon production ratio of 0.07 {$\pm$} 0.05, as a lower limit. Although we find that vertical physical processes dominate carbon input to the mixed layer at KEO, it remains unclear how horizontal features, such as eddies, influence carbon production and export by altering nutrient supply as well as the depth of winter ventilation. Further research evaluating linkages between Kuroshio Extension jet instabilities, eddy activity, and nutrient supply mechanisms is needed to adequately characterize the drivers and sensitivities of carbon cycling near KEO.},

  abstract = {Combining satellite altimetry with Argo profile data a systematic observational estimate of mesoscale eddy signatures in surface mixed-layer depth (MLD) is provided across the Southern Ocean (SO). Eddy composite MLD anomalies are shallow in cyclones, deep in anticyclones, and increase in magnitude with eddy amplitude. Their magnitudes show a pronounced seasonal modulation roughly following the depth of the climatological mixed layer. Weak eddies of the relatively quiescent SO subtropics feature peak late-winter perturbations of {$\pm$}10 m. Much larger MLD perturbations occur over the vigorous eddies originating along the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) and SO western boundary current systems, with late-winter peaks of -30 m and +60 m in the average over cyclonic and anticyclonic eddy cores (a difference of {$\approx$} 100 m). The asymmetry between modest shallow cyclonic and pronounced deep anticyclonic anomalies is systematic and not accompanied by corresponding asymmetries in eddy amplitude. Nonetheless, the net deepening of the climatological SO mixed layer by this asymmetry in eddy MLD perturbations is estimated to be small (few meters). Eddies are shown to enhance SO MLD variability with peaks in late winter and eddy-intense regions. Anomalously deep late-winter mixed layers occur disproportionately within the cores of anticyclonic eddies, suggesting the mesoscale heightens the frequency of deep winter surface-mixing events along the eddy-intense regions of the SO. The eddy modulation in MLD reported here provides a pathway via which the oceanic mesoscale can impact air-sea fluxes of heat and carbon, the ventilation of water masses, and biological productivity across the SO.},

(2015) in the northwestern Pacific are investigated with 14 years of Argo temperature/salinity (T/S) data between 2002 and 2015. By applying an objective identification procedure to Argo T/S profiles, a total of 337 lens-like STEs that trap cold and fresh homogeneous water are obtained. The STEs' cores are primarily located between 26.5 and 26.9r0 (300{\textendash}800 m) and their shapes share a uniform Gaussian structure in vertical. Vertical and horizontal scale of the STEs is generally between 100 and 200 m and 5 and 15 km, respectively, suggesting that they are in the category of submesoscale processes. According to their different densities and seasonalities, the STEs are classified into upper and lower types with density interface of 26.7r0. The number of upper-type STEs is much larger in spring and summer than in autumn and winter while that of lower-type ones show relatively uniform seasonal distributions. Spatially, the STEs are primarily distributed within the region between the Kuroshio Extension (KE) and subarctic front (SAF) in meridional and 1408E{\textendash}1558E in zonal direction. Based on STEs' spatial distributions and vertical locations, we propose to name these STEs as KE intermediate-layer eddies (Kiddies). Water property analysis suggests that the Kiddies most likely originated from the SAF region. For the upper-type Kiddies, they are probably generated through subduction associated with mixed-layer frontogenesis, which at least contribute to 0.25 Sv annual subduction rate for the layers 26.2{\textendash}26.7r0.},

  abstract = {Horizontal and vertical motions associated with coherent mesoscale structures, including eddies and meanders, are responsible for significant global transports of many properties, including heat and mass. Mesoscale vertical fluxes also influence upper ocean biological productivity by mediating the supply of nutrients into the euphotic layer, with potential impacts on the global carbon cycle. The BrazilMalvinas Confluence (BMC) is a western boundary current region in the South Atlantic with intense mesoscale activity. This region has an active role in the genesis and transformation of water masses and thus is a critical component of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation. The collision between the Malvinas and Brazil Currents over the Patagonian shelf/slope creates an energetic front that translates offshore to form a vigorous eddy field. Recent improvements in gridded altimetric sea level anomaly fields allow us to track BMC mesoscale eddies with high spatial and temporal resolutions using an automated eddy tracker. We characterize the eddies across fourteen 58 3 58 subregions. Eddy-centric composites of tracers and geostrophic currents diagnosed from a global reanalysis of surface and in situ data reveal substantial subregional heterogeneity. The in situ data are also used to compute the evolving quasi-geostrophic vertical velocity (QG-x) associated with each instantaneous eddy instance. The QG-x eddy composites have the expected dipole patterns of alternating upwelling/downwelling, however, the magnitude and sign of azimuthally averaged vertical velocity varies among subregions. Maximum eddy values are found near fronts and sharp topographic gradients. In comparison with regional eddy composites, subregional composites provide refined information about mesoscale eddy heterogeneity.},

  abstract = {A quantitative understanding of the integrated ocean heat content depends on our ability to determine how heat is distributed in the ocean and identify the associated coherent patterns. This study demonstrates how this can be achieved using unsupervised classification of Argo temperature profiles. The classification method used is a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) that decomposes the Probability Density Function of a dataset into a weighted sum of Gaussian modes. It is determined that the North Atlantic Argo dataset of temperature profiles contains 8 groups of vertically coherent heat patterns, or classes. Each of the temperature profile classes reveals unique and physically coherent heat distributions along the vertical axis. A key result of this study is that, when mapped in space, each of the 8 classes is found to define an oceanic region, even if no spatial information was used in the model determination. The classification result is independent of the location and time of the ARGO profiles. Two classes show cold anomalies throughout the water column with amplitude decreasing with depth. They are found to be localized in the subpolar gyre and along the poleward flank of the Gulf Stream and North Atlantic Current (NAC). One class has nearly zero anomalies and a large spread throughout the water column. It is found mostly along the NAC. One class has warm anomalies near the surface (50m) and cold ones below 200m. It is found in the tropical/equatorial region. The remaining four classes have warm anomalies throughout the water column, one without depth dependance (in the southeastern part of the subtropical gyre), the other three with clear maximums at different depths (100m, 400m and 1000m). These are found along the southern flank of the North Equatorial Current, the western part of the subtropical gyre and over the West European Basin. These results are robust to both the seasonal variability and to method parameters such as the size of the analyzed domain.},

These ratios are a direct result of a buoyancy budget with respect to buoyancy surfaces, and these ratios are calculated from knowledge of the stratification in the abyss along with the assumed e-folding height that characterizes the decrease of the magnitude of the turbulent diapycnal buoyancy flux away from the seafloor. These strong diapycnal upward and downward volume transports are confined to a few hundred kilometers of the continental boundaries, with no appreciable diapycnal motion in the bulk of the interior ocean.},

  abstract = {To better understand coastal sea level variability and changes, a theory that predicts sea levels along a curved western boundary using interior ocean sea level information is proposed. The western boundary sea level at a particular latitude is expressed by the sum of contributions from interior sea levels propagating onto the western boundary by long Rossby waves between that latitude and a higher latitude, and from the western boundary sea level at the higher latitude. This theory is examined by using a linear, reduced gravity model. A comparison between the theory and the model shows good agreement. A simple scaling law (or rule of thumb) derived from the theory provides a measure of the higher-latitude sea level and ocean interior sea level contributions. The theory is then tested using data from 34 climate models in phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) for dynamic sea level changes between the end of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. The theory captures the nearly uniform sea level rise from the Labrador Sea to New York City (NYC), with a reduction in the increase of sea level farther south toward the equator, qualitatively consistent with the CMIP5 multimodel ensemble, even though the theory underestimates the equatorward reduction rate. Along the South American east coast, the theory successfully reproduced the spatial pattern of the sea level change. The theory suggests a strong link between a sea level rise hot spot along the northeastern coast of North America and the sea level increase in the Labrador Sea, consistent with the result that rates of NYC sea level rise are highly correlated to those in the Labrador Sea in CMIP5 models.},

With a mean latitude along 408N, the western OE front exists primarily west of 1538E and is a continuation of the subarctic gyre western boundary current. The eastern OE front, also appearing along 408N, is located between 1538 and 1708E, whose entity is disconnected from its western counterpart. During 1982{\textendash}2016, both of the OE fronts exhibit prominent decadal fluctuations, although their signals show little contemporaneous correlation. An upper-ocean temperature budget analysis based on the Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean, phase II (ECCO2), state estimate reveals that the advective temperature flux convergence plays a critical role in determining the low-frequency temperature changes relating to the OE fronts. Specifically, the western OE front variability is controlled by the decadal mesoscale eddy modulations in the upstream Kuroshio Extension (KE). An enhanced eddy activity increases the poleward heat transport and works to strengthen the western OE front. The eastern OE front variability, on the other hand, is dictated by both the meridional shift of the KE position and the circulation intensity change immediately north of the eastern OE. Different baroclinic adjustment speeds for the KE and OE are found to cause the in-phase changes between these latter two processes. Lack of contemporaneous correlation between the decadal western and eastern OE variability is found to be related to the interaction of the meridionally migrating KE jet with the Shatsky Rise near 1598E.},

We identified 54,302 oceanic eddies (snapshots) in the KE region during the period of 1999{\textendash}2013. The composite analysis showed that changes in physical parameters modulated by the climatological composite eddies (hereinafter referred to as composite eddies) were mainly confined in the upper 800 m. At the eddy core, the maximum cooling in the composite cyclonic eddy (CE) reaches 2.008C at  360 m, with maximum salinity change of 20.13 psu at  260 m and maximum potential density change of 10.27 kg/m3 at  310 m. In contrast, the maximum warming in the composite anticyclonic eddy (AE) reaches 1.788C at  410 m of the eddy core, with maximum salinity change of 0.12 psu at  260 m and maximum potential density change of 20.22 kg/m3 at  410 m. There were obvious anticlockwise and clockwise geostrophic current anomalies associated with the composite CE and AE, respectively. The seasonal mean eddy-modulated MLD anomaly had significant seasonal variations. In addition, they could modulate opposite PV changes, the magnitude of which varied with depth.},

  abstract = {Decadal variability of eddy activity in the western, subtropical South Pacific is examined using the past two decades of satellite altimetry data. Between 218 and 298S, there is a band of heightened eddy activity. In this region, the eastward South Pacific Subtropical Countercurrent (STCC) overlays the westward South Equatorial Current (SEC). This vertically sheared STCC{\textendash}SEC system is subject to baroclinic instabilities. By using the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Ocean Reanalysis System, version 4 (ORAS4), data and verifying with the gridded Argo float data, low-frequency variations in the state of the ocean in this region are investigated. It is found that the low-frequency changes in the shearing and stratification of the STCC{\textendash}SEC region simultaneously work to modulate the strength of baroclinic instabilities, as measured through the baroclinic growth rate. These changes in the strength of the instabilities consequently affect the observed eddy activity. Using a linearization of the baroclinic growth rate, the contribution to the variability from the changes in shearing is found to be roughly twice as large as those from changes in stratification. Additionally, changes in the temperature and salinity fields are both found to have significant impacts on the low-frequency variability of shearing and stratification, for which salinity changes are responsible for 50\%{\textendash}75\% of the variability as caused by temperature changes. However, the changes in all these parameters do not occur concurrently and can alternately work to negate or augment each other.},

After evaluating the basic performance of FORA-WNP30, the interannual to decadal variability is analyzed. Overall, FORA-WNP30 reproduces basic features in the western North Pacific well. One of outstanding features in FORA-WNP30 is that anomalous events such as the Kuroshio large meander and anomalous intrusion of the Oyashio in the 1980s, when there were no altimeter data, are successfully reproduced. FORA-WNP30 is therefore a valuable dataset for a variety of oceanographic research topics and potentially for related fields such as climate study, meteorology and fisheries.},

In this study, we investigate seasonal variability of eddy kinetic energy (EKE) over this region and its associated dynamic mechanism using a global, eddy-resolving ocean general circulation model (OGCM) simulation, the equatorial mooring data, and satellite altimeter observations. The seasonal-varying enhanced EKE signals are found to expand westward from 1008W in June to 1808W in December between 08N and 68N. This westward expansion in EKE is closely connected to the barotropically-baroclinically unstable zonal flows that are in thermal-wind balance with the seasonal-varying thermocline trough along 48N. By adopting an 11=2-layer reduced-gravity model, we confirm that the seasonal perturbation of the thermocline trough is dominated by the anticyclonic wind stress curl forcing, which develops due to southerly winds along 48N from June to December.},

  abstract = {Previous studies have found that the decadal variability of eddy kinetic energy (EKE) in the upstream Kuroshio Extension is negatively correlated with the jet strength, which seems counterintuitive at first glance because linear stability analysis usually suggests that a stronger jet would favor baroclinic instability and thus lead to stronger eddy activities. Using a time-varying energetics diagnostic methodology, namely, the localized multiscale energy and vorticity analysis (MS-EVA), and the MS-EVA-based nonlinear instability theory, this study investigates the physical mechanism responsible for such variations with the state estimate from the Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean (ECCO), Phase II. For the first time, it is found that the decadal modulation of EKE is mainly controlled by the barotropic instability of the background flow. During the high-EKE state, violent meanderings efficiently induce strong barotropic energy transfer from mean kinetic energy (MKE) to EKE despite the rather weak jet strength. The reverse is true in the low-EKE state. Although the enhanced meander in the high-EKE state also transfers a significant portion of energy from mean available potential energy (MAPE) to eddy available potential energy (EAPE) through baroclinic instability, the EAPE is not efficiently converted to EKE as the two processes are not well correlated at low frequencies revealed in the time-varying energetics. The decadal modulation of barotropic instability is found to be in pace with the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation but with a time lag of approximately 2 years.},

Among them, many are subsurface intensified with strongest signals in the ocean interior such as mode-water eddies, which trap water masses with distinctive properties and carry them over long distances. With both Argo profiling floats and atmospheric reanalysis data we showed that the structure of these eddies obeys a universal rule. Hence their three-dimensional hydrographic fields can be readily reconstructed from very limited information. More interestingly, the volume of water trapped and moved by a mode-water eddy is much greater than previously thought; it has a three-compartment structure in the vertical with the mode water being sandwiched between two layers of notably different properties and accounting for only a portion of the total trapped volume.},

Based on altimeter sea surface heights between 1992 and 2014, a total of 19 prominent KLC eddy shedding (KLCES) events were identified, among which four events were confirmed by the concurrent moored and satellite observations. Compared to the leaping behavior of Kuroshio, KLCES is a relatively short-duration phenomenon that primarily occurs in boreal autumn and winter. The KLC and its shedding anticyclonic eddy (AE) trap a large amount of Pacific water with high temperature{\textendash}salinity and low chlorophyll concentration in the upper layer. The corresponding annual-mean transport caused by KLCES reaches 0.24{\textendash}0.38 Sv (1 Sv [ 106 m3 s21), accounting for 6.8\%{\textendash}10.8\% of the upper-layer Luzon Strait transport. Altimeter-based statistics show that among ;90\% of the historical KLCES events, a cyclonic eddy (CE) is immediately generated behind the AE southwest of Taiwan. Both energetics and stability analyses reveal that because of its large horizontal velocity shear southwest of Taiwan, the northern branch of KLC is strongly unstable and the barotropic instability of KLC constitutes the primary generation mechanism for the CE. After CE is generated, it quickly grows and gradually migrates southward, which in turn facilitates the detachment of AE from KLC. The intrinsic relationship between KLC and CE explains well why eddy pairs are commonly observed in the region southwest of Taiwan.},

While the focus has so far been on the balanced dynamics of these instabilities, they occur in and depend on an environment shaped by atmospherically forced small-scale turbulence. In this study, idealized numerical simulations are presented that allow the development of both baroclinic instability and convective small-scale turbulence, with simple control over the relative strength. If the convection is only weakly forced, baroclinic instability restratifies the layer and shuts off convection, as expected. With increased forcing, however, it is found that baroclinic instabilities are remarkably resilient to the presence of convection. Even if the instability is too weak to restratify the layer and shut off convection, the instability still grows in the convecting environment and generates baroclinic eddies and fronts. This suggests that despite the vigorous atmospherically forced small-scale turbulence in winter mixed layers, baroclinic instabilities can persistently grow, generate balanced submesoscale turbulence, and modify the bulk properties of the upper ocean.},

  abstract = {Intense 50-day oscillations have been previously observed at the entrance of Celebes Sea, and their formation has been suggested to be a result of Rossby wave resonance where the frequency of cyclonic eddy shedding by the intruding Mindanao Current matches that of the gravest Rossby mode of the semienclosed Celebes Sea basin. Using the ocean state estimate of 1993{\textendash}2016 from the Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean, Phase II, we detected strong interannual modulations in the shedding of cyclonic eddies at the Celebes Sea entrance. Active eddy sheddings occurred during 1993, 2002{\textendash}2003, 2006{\textendash}2010, and 2013{\textendash}2015. Southward shifting of the wind-driven North Pacific tropical gyre and the concurrent strengthening of the Mindanao Current southeast of the Mindanao Island in these years are found to be inducive for the generation of cyclonic eddies intruding into the Celebes Sea. Modulated by the activity of eddy sheddings, the upper ocean water mass properties in both the Celebes Sea and Makassar Strait exhibit noticeable interannual changes with less saline waters appearing in the 75- to 175-m layer during the active eddy shedding years.},

  abstract = {A region of elevated mesoscale eddy activity spans the subtropical southern Indian Ocean (SSIO) between Madagascar and Australia. The interannual and decadal changes in eddy activity in the SSIO eddy band, as represented by the variability of eddy kinetic energy (EKE), have implications for the large-scale circulation, mixed-layer budgets, and biological activity. An analysis of nearly two and a half decades of sea level anomaly (SLA) data from merged satellite altimetry shows that, in the southeast Indian Ocean east of 90{$\circ$}E, the variations of EKE and SLA are positively correlated on interannual and decadal time scales. Moreover, EKE exhibits a multidecadal increasing linear trend that corresponds to an increasing trend of SLA in the region. The EKE-SLA covariability in the southeast Indian Ocean does not appear to be associated with a preference for anticyclonic over cyclonic eddy activity; rather, it can be attributed to the common remote forcing from the tropical Pacific associated with the El Ni{\~n}o{\textendash}Southern Oscillation and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation. In the west central SSIO, wind stress curl just south of the eddy band forces potential vorticity anomalies that affect conditions for instability in the west central SSIO; potential density and potential vorticity gradient anomalies also suggest a remote forcing mechanism originating in the region southwest of Australia. The interannual to multidecadal variability of EKE in the SSIO and its relationship with large-scale SLA has implications for mixed-layer dynamics and biogeochemistry and provides a basis for assessment of model simulations of eddy activity in the region.},

  abstract = {South Indian Ocean eddies (SIDDIES), originating from a high evaporation region in the eastern Indian Ocean, are investigated by tracking individual eddies from satellite data and co-located Argo floats. A subsurface-eddy identification method, based on its steric dynamic height anomaly, is devised to assign Argo profiles to surface eddies (surfSIDDIES) or subsurface eddies (subSIDDIES). These westward-propagating, longlived features ({$>$}3 months) prevail over a preferential latitudinal band, forming a permanent structure linking the eastern to the western Indian Ocean, that we call the 'SIDDIES Corridor'. Key features have been revealed in the mean thermohaline vertical structure of these eddies. Anticyclonic SIDDIES are characterized by positive subsurface salinity anomalies, with subSIDDIES not exhibiting negative surface anomalies, as opposed to surfSIDDIES. Cyclonic subSIDDIES also occur, but their related salinity anomalies are weaker. SubSIDDIES exhibit two cores of different temperature polarities in their surface and subsurface levels. Cyclonic subSIDDIES have their cores at around 150-200 m depth along the 25.4-25.8 kg m23 potential density layer with anticyclonic subSIDDIES having their cores at 250-300 m along the 26-26.4 kg m23 density layer. The SIDDIES corridor acts as a zonal pathway for both eddy-types to advect water masses and biogeochemical properties across the basin. This study provides a new insight on heat/salt fluxes, showing that 58\% (32\%) of the total heat eddy-flux is ascribed to cyclonic (anticyclonic) subSIDDIES, respectively, in the eastern South Indian Ocean. Anticyclonic subSIDDIES have also been found to be the sole high-saline water eddy-conveyor toward the western Indian Ocean.},

Here we used the AMEDA eddy detection algorithm to track and monitor a particular anticyclonic eddy from its birth to its death. The analysis of remote sensing data sets (AVISO and sea surface temperature) revealed that this anticyclone split from an Algerian eddy, in October 2015, interacted with the North Balearic Front and merged 7 months later, in May 2016, with a similar Algerian eddy. In early spring 2016, a field experiment during the ProtevsMed 2016 cruise thoroughly investigated this eddy, when it was located near the North Balearic Front, taking high-resolution (Seasoar) hydrological transects, several Conductivity-Temperature-Depth (CTD) casts, and Lowered Acoustic Doppler Profiler measurements. In addition, four drifting buoys were released in the eddy core. These in situ measurements revealed that the vertical structure of this anticyclone was made of two water lenses of very different origins (Atlantic Water above and Western Intermediate Water below) spinning together. In the vicinity of the North Balearic Front, which may act as a dynamical barrier to such oceanic structures, the eddy interacted with a subsurface anticyclonic eddy made of modal water, which fostered cross-front exchanges generating filaments by stirring. The high-resolution sampling revealed fine-scale structures both adjacent to the eddy and within its core.},

  abstract = {By analyzing 22 years (1993{\textendash}2015) of daily eddy data, statistics of surface eddy properties were refreshed in the South China Sea. More than 7,000 of historical Argo profiles were collocated into eddy-centered coordinates to reveal the composite mean three-dimensional structure of eddies. The results indicate that eddies of both polarities have long conical shape, with a maximum (minimum) density anomaly of 0.55 kg/m3 ({\`A}0.51 kg/m3) at 60 m (90 m) in the composite cyclonic (anticyclonic) eddy. Temperature and salinity anomalies also peak at eddy cores, with values of {\`A}1.5 {\textdegree}C and 0.15 psu in the cyclonic eddy and 1.4 {\textdegree}C and {\`A}0.16 psu in the anticyclonic eddy. The temperature and density anomalies extend vertically to 400{\textendash}500 m, while the salinity anomalies are apparent only in the upper 150 m. The temperature anomalies contribute about 90\% of the density anomalies. Mixed layer depths in cyclonic eddies are on average 15 m shallower than those in anticyclonic eddies. The rotation of the composite cyclonic (anticyclonic) eddy generates meridional heat transport of 1.4 {\texttimes} 1012 W ({\`A}3.1 {\texttimes} 1012 W) and salt transport of {\`A}4.0 {\texttimes} 104 kg/s (5.6 {\texttimes} 104 kg/s). More than 90\% of the heat and salt transports are concentrated in the upper 300 and 100 m, respectively. Compared to the meridional transports, the westward propagation of eddies results in zonal heat and salt transports on the same orders of magnitudes. The westward propagation of eddies also generates a basin-scale westward water transport of 1.4 Sv, equivalent to about 30\% of the annual-mean Luzon Strait transport.},

  abstract = {🔤黑潮延伸区以其强烈的涡流活动而闻名。在本文中，我们利用 1993 年至 2012 年在黑潮扩展区域（140-180{\textdegree}E，25-45{\textdegree}N）的卫星测高测量的海面高度异常数据，分析了涡流特征：涡流大小，极性，寿命，强度、轨迹以及空间和时间分布。使用 Argo 浮标测量的温度和盐度垂直剖面，我们检查了涡流对垂直分层的影响。在这 20 年期间，确定了 7,574 个涡流（基于以下完整的涡流轨迹），其寿命等于或超过 4 周。发现气旋和反气旋涡流的数量大致相同。涡流大小的分布在半径约 40 公里处达到峰值。峰值处的半径与第一斜压变形半径或黑潮流的水平切变尺度处于同一数量级。归一化的涡统计特征表明，涡在其生命的不同阶段具有不同的特征。在寿命超过 50 周的涡流中，在 35{\textdegree}N 以北（南）发现了更多的反气旋（气旋）涡流。相反，在寿命短于 20 周的涡流中，在 35{\textdegree}N 以北（南）发现了更多的气旋（反气旋）涡流。涡流的不对称分布表明两种不同的涡流产生机制：（1）黑潮路径中曲流的发展导致具有更长寿命（更大尺寸）的涡流夹断和（2）水平剪切不稳定（正压不稳定）导致寿命较短的涡流（较小的尺寸）。我们进一步应用涡分辨数值产品来定量研究涡流产生机制。通俗易懂的总结 我们用 20 年的卫星数据分析了涡流特征，并检查了涡流对垂直分层的影响。此外，通过统计结果，我们提出了两种涡流产生机制：流动水平剪切诱导涡流产生和流道曲折导致涡流产生。然后，我们进一步应用涡分辨数值积来定量研究涡的产生机制。 The Kuroshio Extension region is well known for its strong eddy activity. In this paper, using satellite altimetry-measured sea surface height anomaly data from 1993 to 2012 in an extended Kuroshio Extension region (140{\textendash}180{\textdegree}E, 25{\textendash}45{\textdegree}N), we analyze eddy characteristics: eddy size, polarity, lifetime, intensity, trajectory, and spatial and temporal distributions. Using temperature and salinity vertical profiles measured by Argo floats, we examine the eddy impact on vertical stratification. During the 20-year period, 7,574 eddies are identified (based on following complete eddy trajectories) with a lifetime equal to or longer than 4 weeks. The numbers of cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies are found to be approximately the same. The distribution of eddy sizes peaks at a radius of about 40 km. The radius at the peak is at the same order as the first baroclinic deformation radius or the horizontal shear scale of the Kuroshio flow. The normalized eddy statistical characteristics show that eddies have different characteristics at different stages of their lifetimes. Among eddies with lifetimes longer than 50 weeks, more anticyclonic (cyclonic) eddies are found north (south) of 35{\textdegree}N. In contrast, among eddies with lifetimes shorter than 20 weeks, more cyclonic (anticyclonic) eddies are found north (south) of 35{\textdegree}N. The asymmetric distribution of eddies suggests two different eddy generation mechanisms: (1) the development of meanders in the Kuroshio path leading to the pinch off of eddies with longer lifetime (larger size) and (2) horizontal shear instability (barotropic instability) leading to eddies of shorter life (smaller size). We further apply an eddy-resolved numerical product to quantitatively investigate the eddy generation mechanisms. Plain Language Summary We analyze eddy characteristics with 20-year satellite data and examine the eddy impact on vertical stratification. Besides, through the statistic result, we propose two eddy generation mechanisms: flow horizontal shear-induced eddy generation and the meander of flow path leading to the eddy generation. And then, we further apply an eddy-resolved numerical product to quantitatively investigate the eddy generation mechanisms.},

  abstract = {In the Southwest Pacific Ocean, waters transit from the subtropical gyre before being redistributed equatorward and poleward. While the mean pathways are known, the contribution to the mixing and transport of the water from mesoscale eddies has not been comprehensively investigated. In this research, satellite altimetry data, combined with an eddy detection and tracking algorithm is used to investigate the distribution and surface characteristics of mesoscale eddies in this region of complex bathymetry (108S{\textendash}308S, 1408E{\textendash}1908E). Detected eddies are then colocalized with in situ data from Argo floats to determine their vertical structure and the effect of eddies on the water masses. The numerous islands affect the eddy behavior as most eddies are formed in the lee of islands, propagate westward and decay when encountering shallow bathymetry. Eddies are sparse and short-lived in the tropical area north of Fiji, impacting only the top 200 meters of water. They do not appear to be able to trap and transport waters in this region. In the Coral Sea, a region of lateral shear between currents transporting waters of different origins, eddies are more numerous and energetic. They affect the water properties down to at least 500 m depth, and anticyclonic eddies trap water to  200 m, contributing to the upper thermocline waters mixing and transport. South of New Caledonia, mesoscale eddies are ubiquitous, with typical lifetimes longer than 5 months. They affect the temperature, salinity, and velocities down to  1,000 m depth, and weakly contribute to the mixing of lower thermocline waters.},

  abstract = {The Indo-Atlantic interocean exchanges achieved by Agulhas Rings are tightly linked to global ocean circulation and climate. Yet they are still poorly understood because they are difficult to identify and follow. We propose here an original assessment on Agulhas Rings, achieved by TOEddies, a new eddy identification and tracking algorithm that we applied over 24 years of satellite altimetry. Its main novelty lies in the detection of eddy splitting and merging events. These are particularly abundant and significantly impact the concept of a trajectory associated with a single eddy, which becomes less obvious than previously admitted. To overcome this complication, we have defined a network of segments that group together in relatively complex trajectories. Such a network provides an original assessment of the routes and the history of Agulhas Rings. It links 730,481 eddies into 6,363 segments that cluster into Agulhas Ring trajectories of different orders. Such an order depends on the affiliation of the eddies and segments, in a similar way as a tree of life. Among them, we have identified 122 order 0 trajectories that can be considered as the major trajectories associated to a single eddy, albeit it has undergone itself splitting and merging events. Despite the disappearance of many eddies in the altimeter signal in the Cape Basin, a significant fraction can be followed from the Indian Ocean to the South Brazil Current with, on average, 3.5 years to cross the entire South Atlantic.},

  abstract = {Automated methods are important for the identification of mesoscale eddies in the large volume of oceanic data provided by altimetric measurements and numerical simulations. This paper presents an optimized algorithm for detecting and tracking eddies from two-dimensional velocity fields. This eddy identification uses a hybrid methodology based on physical parameters and geometrical properties of the velocity field, and it can be applied to various fields having different spatial resolutions without a specific fine-tuning of the parameters. The efficiency and the robustness of the angular momentum eddy detection and tracking algorithm (AMEDA) was tested with three different types of input data: the 1/88 Archiving, Validation, and Interpretation of Satellite Oceanographic Data (AVISO) geostrophic velocity fields available for the Mediterranean Sea; the output of the idealized Regional Ocean Modeling System numerical model; and the surface velocity field obtained from particle imagery on a rotating tank experiment. All these datasets describe the dynamical evolution of mesoscale eddies generated by the instability of a coastal current. The main advantages of AMEDA are as follows: the algorithm is robust to the grid resolution, it uses a minimal number of tunable parameters, the dynamical features of the detected eddies are quantified, and the tracking procedure identifies the merging and splitting events. The proposed method provides a complete dynamical evolution of the detected eddies during their lifetime. This allows for identifying precisely the formation areas of long-lived eddies, the region where eddy splitting or merging occurs frequently, and the interaction between eddies and oceanic currents.},

  abstract = {The vertical structure of a recently detached Loop Current Eddy (LCE) is studied using in situ data collected with an underwater glider from August to November 2016. Altimetry and Argo data are analyzed to discuss the context of the eddy shedding and evolution as well as the origin and transformation of its thermohaline properties. The LCE appeared as a large body of nearly homogeneous water between 50 and 250 m confined between the seasonal and main thermoclines. A temperature anomaly relative to surrounding Gulf's water of up to 9.7{$\circ$} C was observed within the eddy core. The salinity structure had a double core pattern. The subsurface fresh core had a negative anomaly of 0.27 practical salinity unit, while the deeper saline core's positive anomaly reached 1.22 practical salinity unit. Both temperature and salinity maxima were stronger than previously reported. The saline core, of Caribbean origin, was well conserved during its journey from the Yucatan Basin to the Loop Current and at least 7 months after eddy detachment. The fresher homogeneous core resulted from surface diabatic transformations including surface heat fluxes and mixing within the top 200 m during the winter preceding eddy detachment. Heat and salt excess carried by the LCE were large and require important negative heat fluxes and positive fresh water input to be balanced. The geostrophic velocity structure had the form of a subsurface intensified vortex ring.},

With the exception of the Pacific and Indian sectors of the Southern Ocean, the seasonal KE fluctuations of the surface balanced and unbalanced motions are out of phase because of the occurrence of mixed layer instability in winter and trapping of unbalanced motion KE in shallow mixed layer in summer. The combined effect of these seasonal changes renders Lt to be 20 km during winter in 80\% of the Northern Hemisphere oceans between 258 and 458N and all of the Southern Hemisphere oceans south of 258S. The transition scale's geographical and seasonal changes are highly relevant to the forthcoming Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission.

Supported by in situ observations and realistic numerical simulations, it is found that in the Yellow Sea, the shelf wave response to the synoptic wind forcing does not match the mathematically symmetric solution of classic double-shelf wave theory, but rather exhibits a westward shift. To study the formation mechanism of this asymmetric structure, an idealized model was used and two sets of experiments were conducted. The results confirm that the asymmetric structure is due to the existence of a topographic waveguide connecting both shelves. For a semienclosed basin, such as the Yellow Sea, a connection at the end of the basin eliminates the potential vorticity barrier between the two shelves and hence plays a role as a connecting waveguide for shelf waves. This waveguide enables the shelf wave to propagate from one shelf to the other shelf and produces the asymmetric response in sea level and upwind flow evolutions.},

Below a thin mixed layer, often \#10 m, the analysis shows several dynamical signatures indicative of submesoscale processes: (i) negative Ertel potential vorticity (PV); (ii) low-PV anomalies with O(1{\textendash}10) km lateral extent, where the vorticity estimated on isopycnals and the isopycnal thickness are tightly coupled, varying in lockstep to yield low PV; (iii) flow conditions susceptible to forced symmetric instability (FSI) or bearing the imprint of earlier FSI events; (iv) negative lateral gradients in the absolute momentum field (inertial instability); and (v) strong contribution from differential sheared advection at O(1) km scales to the growth rate of the depth-averaged stratification.

  abstract = {Internal gravity waves (IGWs) and balanced motions (BMs) with scales {$<$}100-km capture most of the vertical velocity field in the upper ocean. They have, however, different impacts on the ocean energy budget, which explains the need to partition motions into BMs and IGWs. One way is to exploit the synergy of using different satellite observations, the only observations with global coverage, and a reasonable spatial and temporal resolution. But we need first to characterize and understand their signatures on the different surface oceanic fields. This study addresses this issue by using an ocean global numerical simulation with high-resolution (1/48{\textdegree}). Our methodology is based on the analysis of the 12,000 frequency-wave number spectra to discriminate these two classes of motions in the surface kinetic energy, sea surface height, sea surface temperature, sea surface salinity, relative vorticity, and divergence fields and for two seasons. Results reveal a complex picture worldwide of the partition of motions between IGWs and BMs in the different surface fields, depending on the season, the hemisphere, and low and high eddy kinetic energy regions. But they also highlight some generic properties on the impact of these two classes of motions on the different fields. This points to the synergy of using present and future satellite observations to assess the ocean kinetic energy on a global scale. The 12,000 frequency-wave number spectra represent a World Ocean Atlas of the surface ocean dynamics not fully exploited in the present study. We hope the use of this World Ocean Atlas by other studies will lead to extend much these results.},

Key ocean{\textendash}atmosphere interaction processes for the ENSO effect are investigated using the Pacific Ocean{\textendash}Global Atmosphere (POGA) experiment with a coupled general circulation model, where tropical Pacific sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies are restored to follow observations while the atmosphere and oceans are fully coupled elsewhere. The POGA shows skills in simulating the ENSO-forced warming of the tropical Indian Ocean and an anomalous anticyclonic circulation pattern over the northwestern tropical Pacific in the post{\textendash}El Ni{\~n}o spring and summer. The 10-member POGA ensemble allows decomposing Indo-western Pacific variability into the ENSO forced and ENSO-unrelated (internal) components. Internal variability is comparable to the ENSO forcing in magnitude and independent of ENSO amplitude and phase. Random internal variability causes apparent decadal modulations of ENSO correlations over the Indo-western Pacific, which are high during epochs of high ENSO variance. This is broadly consistent with instrumental observations over the past 130 years as documented in recent studies. Internal variability features a sea level pressure pattern that extends into the north Indian Ocean and is associated with coherent SST anomalies from the Arabian Sea to the western Pacific, suggestive of ocean{\textendash}atmosphere coupling.},

  abstract = {Temperature in the Eastern China Seas (ECS), including the Bohai, Yellow, and East China seas, is crucially important with regard to weather forecasting and fishery activities of adjacent countries. Although sea surface temperature (SST) in the ECS has demonstrated a dramatically accelerated trend of warming after a regime shift (1976{\textendash}1996), trends beneath the surface remain poorly understood because of the sparsity of observations. This study used in situ hydrographic data from 1976 to 1996 to examine upperocean temperature trends in the ECS. It was found that the multilevel trends show consistency with that of the surface water; i.e., warming is faster in winter than summer. However, the magnitudes of the trends weaken with increasing depth. Furthermore, the seasonal difference in the upper ocean is mainly associated with the warm currents in the ECS, which implies an essential contribution from horizontal advection. These phenomena could also be detected from data acquired from the routinely observed PN and 34{\textdegree}N sections. The spatiotemporal patterns of temperature trends in the upper ECS extend our understanding beyond the SST, especially highlighting the role of ocean dynamics in forming temperature patterns beneath the surface in comparison with atmospheric effects.},

The instability results from the release of available potential energy, which can be generated because of the observed bottom intensification of turbulent mixing in the deep ocean, or the Ekman adjustment of a current on a slope. Linear stability analysis suggests that the growth rates of bottom boundary layer baroclinic instabilities can be comparable to those of the surface mixed layer mode and are relatively insensitive to topographic slope angle, implying the instability is robust and potentially active in many areas of the global oceans. The solutions of two separate onedimensional theories of the bottom boundary layer are both demonstrated to be linearly unstable to baroclinic instability, and results from an example nonlinear simulation are shown. Implications of these findings for understanding bottom boundary layer dynamics and processes are discussed.},

  abstract = {The meridional shift of Oyashio Extension (OE) front in the past 36 years was analyzed by using the high-resolution Optimum Interpolation SST data. The annual mean OE front has moved northward in its eastern part (between 157{\textdegree}E and 172{\textdegree}E) by 0.018{\textdegree}/year but no obvious poleward shift in the western OE front (between 145{\textdegree}E and 157{\textdegree}E). It is shown that the trade wind became stronger and broader, and the whole wind field moved northward in the past 36 years, shifting the zero wind stress curl line (or the zero Sverdrup streamline) and the eastern OE front northward. The above mechanism is confirmed by a 1.5-layer reduced-gravity model simulation as well as the altimetry data. Meanwhile, the local Ekman heat transport anomaly due to the wind field changes is found to be one of the contributors to the northward shift of the eastern OE front. However, both wind stress curl and local Ekman heat transport anomalies do not favor northward shift of the western OE front. Plain Language Summary The Oyashio Extension (OE) front between the subtropical and subpolar ocean circulations is key region in the climate system with huge heat and mass transport variability, strong atmospheric storms, as well as major CO2 sinks. Ongoing efforts are being sought to understand the OE front variability in connection with climate change, but how its meridional shift under wind changes in the past several decades remain unclear. Here, we analyze the OE front shift from 1982-2017. Our results show that the eastern OE front shift northward with the zero wind stress curl line (zero Sverdrup stream line) moving northward, while the western OE front has no shift. The anomalous Ekman heat transport is also favorable for the west-east different shift of OE front. We believe that this work will appeal to the readers of GRL because it not only provides quantifications of the OE front shift based on high-resolution observations, but more importantly, also supplies new clues to the dynamic relationship between the OE front variability and the wind changes. When published, we believe our study will lead to improvement of climate prediction and projection especially in the ocean western boundary current regions, which is the most challenge area for modelling.},

  abstract = {The Kuroshio Extension Region (KER) has the most active oceanic mesoscale eddies within the North Pacific Ocean, nevertheless, there is a lack of observations on the three-dimensional (3D) fine structure of these eddies. Satellite altimeter data and underway observations were used in combination to conduct a fine-scale characterisation of the 3D thermohaline structure and circulation of a mesoscale cyclonic eddy within the KER during June, 2014. The results showed that isotherms in the six in situ sections consistently exhibited enhanced upward bending and negative temperature anomalies were distinct. At locations closer to the centre of the eddy, the negative temperature anomalies became more significant and the intensity of the cold core became more pronounced. The isohalines also trended upwards, with the upper and lower levels having negative and positive anomalies, respectively. The isohalines at the various layers similarly exhibited a clear eddy-like structure from the subsurface down to 1,000 m. Both the actual flow field measured by the Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) and the geostrophic flow field based on thermohaline data indicated a significant asymmetric cyclonic circulation structure. By comparing with the in situ data, the HYbrid Coordinate Ocean Model (HYCOM) is capable of depicting the mesoscale eddy while the magnitude and eddy location deviate from in situ observations.},

  abstract = {Using the Estimating Circulation and Climate of the Ocean Phase II product, this study investigates the eddy characteristics and energetics in two dynamical regimes within the Kuroshio Extension (KE) region. Based on the empirical orthogonal function analysis, it is found that the decadal evolution of eddy kinetic energy in the KE region is characterized by a delayed negative correlation between the upstream and downstream. Besides the out-of-phase change in eddy activity levels, eddy characteristics and energetics in the upstream KE are also different from those in the downstream. In the upstream region, eddies are stretched in the zonal direction and the unstable state is characterized by strong eddy-shedding processes. During these processes, cyclonic eddies are found to be formed in the first quasi-stationary meander and finally pinched off from the KE jet. Energy budget illustrates that the eddy shedding processes are triggered by baroclinic instability, while barotropic instability becomes the dominated energy source after the meander is fully developed. Accompanied by the generation of cyclonic eddies, significant inverse energy cascade is detected. When the upstream KE is stable, the eddy activity is dominated by baroclinic instability and the inverse energy cascade occurs similarly. Distinct from the upstream, eddies in the downstream KE tend to be stretched in the meridional direction and the decadal variability of eddy kinetic energy in this region is mainly regulated by the upstream through lateral advection. Plain Language Summary Based on classic physical oceanography theory, oceanic eddies are generated mainly through the vertical shear of background mean flow, i.e. baroclinic instability (BC). A stronger mean flow should favor BC and lead to more eddy generation. However, at decadal timescales, the correlation between the strength of the Kuroshio Extension (KE) jet and the regional eddy kinetic energy (EKE) level is negative, therefore the decadal variability of mesoscale eddy field in the KE system cannot be simply explained by the classic instability theory. This study explores in great depth the dynamical processes in the unstable state in the upstream KE and analyzes the evolution of eddy energetics during these processes. It is found that unstable events in the upstream KE are characterized by strong eddy-shedding processes. During these events, cyclonic eddies are found to be formed in the first quasi-stationary meander and finally pinched off from the KE jet. During these processes, both BC and barotropic energy transfer are important in the generation of eddies. This study will be a step toward the understanding of low-frequency variability in strong oceanic current regions in the global ocean.},

Distinct seasonal cycles of eddy kinetic energy (EKE) are observed in the upstream and downstream regions of the Kuroshio Extension. In the upstream Kuroshio Extension, the EKE peaks in summer and reaches its minimum in winter over an annual cycle. By diagnosing the spatiotemporal structures of the canonical barotropic and baroclinic energy transfers, we found that internal processes due to mixed instabilities (i.e., both barotropic and baroclinic instabilities) are responsible for the seasonal eddy variability in this region. In the downstream Kuroshio Extension, the EKE exhibits a different annual cycle, peaking in spring and gradually decaying from summer to winter. Significant inverse barotropic energy transfer is found in this region throughout the year, leaving baroclinic instability the primary energy source for the regional seasonal eddy variability. Besides the internal redistribution, it is also evident that the external forcing may influence the Kuroshio Extension EKE seasonality{\textemdash}the EKE is found to be more damped by winds during winter than summer.},

  abstract = {The global ocean circulation is forced by large-scale fluxes at the surface and dissipated at small scales by diffusion. To achieve a long-term equilibrium requires a dynamical route that transfers energy from large to dissipative scales. The submesoscale ageostrophic motions (1{\textendash}50 km) have been hypothesized recently to play a critical role in this route by extracting energy from mesoscale eddies (50{\textendash}500 km) that contain the majority of oceanic kinetic energy. By combining global surface velocity measurements by drifters and satellite altimeter-tracked eddy data set, we show that the submesoscale ageostrophic kinetic energy exhibits unexpected global mean features through the life cycle of mesoscale eddies. The ageostrophic energy is relatively small in eddy's mature phase but is large both in formation/decaying phases. Furthermore, the energy level of ageostrophic motions depends positively on the local geostrophic strain rate, suggesting that the geostrophic deformation field may dictate the energy transfer from mesoscale eddies to submesoscale motions.},

The wind-forced sea surface height anomalies influence the upstream Agulhas Current volume transports.

First, we present a streampath-based approach to build a large-scale eddy image dataset from ocean current data and apply our dataset to eddy detection. Second, by combining the multilayer features in the neural network with the characteristics of the eddies, we achieve a competitive detection result with an mAP of 90.64\% and an average SDR of 98.91\%, which performs better than the previous methods.

Multicore structures were identified using an improved geometric closed-contour algorithm of sea surface height. Splitting and merging events were discerned from continuous time series maps of sea level anomalies. Multicore structures represent an intermediate stage in the process of eddy evolution, similar to the generation of multiple nuclei in a cell as a preparatory phase for cell division. Generally, splitting or merging events can substantially change (by a factor of 2 or more) the eddy scale, amplitude, and eddy kinetic energy. Specifically, merging (splitting) generally causes an increase (decrease) of eddy properties. Multicore eddies were found to tend to split into two eddies with different intensities. Similarly, eddy merging is not an interaction of two equal-intensity eddies, and it tends to manifest as a strong eddy merging with a weaker one. A hybrid tracking strategy based on the eddy overlap ratio, considering both multicore and single-core eddies, was used to confirm splitting and merging events globally. The census revealed that eddy splitting and merging do not always occur most frequently in eddy-rich regions; e.g., their frequencies of occurrence in the Antarctic Circumpolar Current and western boundary currents were found to be greater than in midlatitude regions (20{\textendash}35{$\circ$}) to the north and south. Eddy splitting and merging are caused primarily by an unstable configuration of multicore structures due to obvious current{\textendash} or eddy{\textendash}topography interaction, strong current variation, and eddy{\textendash}mean flow interaction.},

  abstract = {In the Arabian Sea, mesoscale eddies are prominent features of the circulation. They influence biological activities, tracer transport, and physical and chemical properties of the seawater. In particular, the pathways of salty water masses outflowing from the marginal seas are strongly impacted by the mesoscale eddies that evolve in the western part of the basin. The impact of mesoscale eddies on the different salty water masses has been investigated in previous studies with altimetric data and in situ data for short durations. In this study, we extend this analysis to most of the mesoscale eddies detected from altimetry data for the period 2000{\textendash}2015. We use Argo floats colocalized with eddies to describe the 3D impact of mesoscale eddies on the dynamical and thermohaline properties of water masses in the Arabian Sea. The 30,000 Argo stations used show a well characterized distribution of water masses in the different sub-basins of the Arabian Sea, with the Persian Gulf Water (PGW) flowing from the north and the Red Sea Outflow Water (RSOW) from the northwest. In addition, colocalizing Argo profiles in or out of these eddies allows for the extraction of temperature and salinity anomalies related to mesoscale eddies. Then, we present the vertical structure of density associated with these eddies. These results allow us to divide the Arabian Sea into areas depending on their hydrological and dynamical properties. In the Gulf of Oman and the Gulf of Aden, the water in the core of eddies is fresher than at their edge. Thus, most of eddies residing in these gulfs were generated in the Arabian Sea. In these eddies, the salinity anomalies corresponding to PGW and RSOW are on average stronger at their edge than in their core; this indicates that eddies in these gulfs impact outflow waters via advecting processes on their rim. Finally, we select the northern part of the Arabian Sea (including the Gulf of Oman), where most Argo profiles were collected. We calculate the composite 3D profiles of angular velocity and salinity anomaly for surface-intensified cyclonic eddies and subsurface anticyclonic eddies, with radii of about 100 km. The velocity profiles computed via the thermal wind equations are validated using surface velocities from altimetry and surface drifter measurements. On average, eddies in the northern Arabian Sea exhibit a clear pattern of PGW in their core. The comparison of these 3D composite structures with a particular cyclone near the Strait of Hormuz and a dipole sampled with a SeaSoar along the Omani Coast shows that they are representative of mesoscale eddies often observed in the area.},

  abstract = {黑潮延伸体区域是中纬度海气相互作用的关键区域,也是海洋涡旋最活跃的区域之一。脱落涡旋的研究在分析和理解海洋中物质和能量的输送以及海-气相互作用等方面起着重要的作用,但是之前的研究并没有很好的区分出该区域从流轴脱落的涡旋、``蛇形''(meanders)以及其他的中尺度涡。本文基于1993-2015年AVISO卫星高度计融合数据,参照WA(Winding-Angle)方法人工统计了从黑潮延伸体流轴脱落的涡旋,并系统分析了该区域脱落涡旋的空间分布特征、运动属性以及季节、年际和类年代际变化特征。23年间共追踪到242个气旋涡,276个反气旋涡,脱落的涡旋主要分布在沙茨基海脊以西区域。从脱落涡旋的源地空间分布来看,气旋涡的形成区域有两个高发区,一个位于黑潮延伸体流轴稳定弯曲处,即144{\textasciitilde}oE-146{\textasciitilde}o E之间的上游区域;另一个位于沙茨基海脊西侧156{\textasciitilde}o E处。而反气旋涡的形成区域也有两个高发区,一个位于沙茨基海脊以西的下游区域,另一个位于148{\textasciitilde}o E处。这些脱落的涡旋大多向西移动,反气旋涡和气旋涡向西移动的平均速度分别为3.52 cm/s和3.89 cm/s,其中有88\%的涡旋再次被流轴吸收。脱落涡旋的平均生命周期为50天,气旋涡和反气旋涡平均半径分别为92.4 km和103.9 km,平均振幅分别为35 cm和32 cm。脱落涡旋的数量显示出了明显的年际和类年代际变化,在流轴的上下游区域,类年代际和年际变化分别占主导地位。在上游区域,脱落涡旋的类年代际变化与黑潮延伸体的强度呈负相关。在季节变化上,夏季脱落形成的涡旋最多,冬季最少。基于脱落涡旋的统计特征,结合Argo浮标资料、日本国家海洋科学与技术研究中心(JAMSTEC)船测资料数据集和WOA13 v2气候态温盐数据,采用客观分析插值法,合成了黑潮延伸体区域脱落涡旋的三维温盐结构,并估算出相关的热量输运。脱落的气旋(反气旋)涡呈现明显的位势温度负(正)异常,自西向东脱落的气旋(反气旋)涡引起的位温异常极值深度逐渐变浅(深)、位温异常值减小。140{\textdegree}-150{\textdegree}E脱落的冷涡由于低位势涡度的副热带模态水的存在,有``双核''结构特征。脱落的气旋(反气旋)涡在小于600 m深度有相对强的负(正)盐度异常;大于600 m深度气旋(反气旋)涡有相对弱的正(负)盐度异常。黑潮延伸体各区域合成脱落涡旋的温、盐异常的影响程度并不完全相同,可能与各区域背景流强度和温盐场有关。脱落涡旋对温盐的平均影响深度可达1 000 m以上。基于涡旋运动轨迹来计算涡旋运动导致的热量输送结果表明,脱落涡旋的经向热量输送值约为0.03 PW,该估算量占黑潮延伸体急流所处纬度的涡旋经向热量输送的三分之一,对北太平洋经向涡旋热量输送有重大贡献。最后,研究了北太平洋副热带西部模态水(NPSTMW)的分布特征以及脱落涡旋对其影响。研究表明黑潮延伸体区域反气旋涡中平均混合层深度和NPSTMW的厚度均大于气旋涡,这也间接证明了,反气旋涡中更易生成模态水。低位势涡度水的强度在合成的脱落涡旋中的分布表明,脱落的反气旋涡中NPSTMW明显强于气旋涡,并且在反气旋涡的东侧有高位涡水体向南输运,而低位涡水体被限制在反气旋涡中心。脱落的反气旋涡中的捕获深度(Trapped Depth)高达950 m,气旋涡中为800 m。},

  abstract = {Oceanic eddies are ubiquitous in global oceans and play a major role in ocean energy transfer and nutrients distribution, thus being significant for understanding ocean current circulation and marine climate change. They are characterized by a combination of high-speed vertical rotations and horizontal movements, leading to irregular three-dimensional spiral structures. While the ability to detect eddies automatically and remotely is crucial to monitoring important spatial{\textendash}temporal dynamics, existing methods are inaccurate because eddies are highly dynamic and the underlying physical processes are not well understood. Typically, remote sensing is used to detect eddies based on physical parameters, geometrics or other handcrafted features. In this paper, we show how Deep Learning may be used to reliably extract higher-level features and then fuse multi-scale features to identify eddies, regardless of their structures and scales. We learn eddy features using two principal component analysis convolutional layers, then perform a non-linear transformation of the features through a binary hashing layer and block-wise histograms. To handle the difficult problem of spatial variability across synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images, we introduce a spatial pyramid model to allow multi-scale features fusion. Finally, a linear support vector machine classifier recognizes the eddies. Our method, dubbed DeepEddy, is benchmarked against a dataset of 20,000 SAR image samples, achieving a 97.8\,{$\pm$}\,1\% accuracy of detection.},

However, the traditional detection method for oceanic mesoscale eddies relies too much on the threshold value and has significant subjectivity. The existing machine learning methods are not mature or purposeful enough, as their train set lacks authority. In view of the above problems, this paper constructs a mesoscale eddy automatic identification and positioning network{\textemdash}OEDNet{\textemdash}based on an object detection network. Firstly, 2D image processing technology is used to enhance the data of a small number of accurate eddy samples annotated by marine experts to generate the train set. Then, the object detection model with a deep residual network, and a feature pyramid network as the main structure, is designed and optimized for small samples and complex regions in the mesoscale eddies of the ocean. Experimental results show that the model achieves better recognition compared to the traditional detection method and exhibits a good generalization ability in different sea areas.},

  abstract = {Mesoscale eddies play a significant role in marine energy transport, marine biological environment and marine climate. Due to their huge impact on the ocean, mesoscale eddy detection has become a hot research area in recent years. Therefore, more and more people are entering the field of mesoscale eddy detection. However, the existing detection methods mainly based on traditional detection methods typically only use Sea Surface Height (SSH) as a variable to detect, resulting in inaccurate performance. In this paper, we propose a mesoscale eddy detection method based on multivariate fusion data to solve this problem. We not only use the SSH variable, but also add the two variables: Sea Surface Temperature (SST) and velocity of flow, achieving a multivariate information fusion input. We design a novel symmetric network, which merges low-level feature maps from the downsampling pathway and high-level feature maps from the upsampling pathway by lateral connection. In addition, we apply dilated convolutions to network structure to increase the receptive field and obtain more contextual information in the case of constant parameter. In the end, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on dataset provided by us, achieving the test set performance of 97.06\% , greatly improved the performance of previous methods of mesoscale eddy detection.},

We present a global analysis of concurrent satellite observations of mesoscale eddies with hydrographic profiles by autonomous Argo floats, revealing rich geographic and seasonal variability in the influence of eddies on mixed layer depth. Anticyclones deepen the mixed layer depth, whereas cyclones thin it, with the magnitude of these eddy-induced mixed layer depth anomalies being largest in winter. Eddy-centric composite averages reveal that the largest anomalies occur at the eddy center and decrease with distance from the center. Furthermore, the extent to which eddies modulate mixed layer depth is linearly related to the sea surface height amplitude of the eddies. Finally, large eddy-mediated mixed layer depth anomalies are more common in anticyclones when compared to cyclones. We present candidate mechanisms for this observed asymmetry.},

  abstract = {Mesoscale eddies have been extensively studied based on the sea surface height anomaly (SSHA). However, it is the sea surface temperature anomaly (SSTA) that is vital to the mesoscale eddy{\textendash}atmosphere interactions. In this study, we analyze the amplitude relationship between SSHA and SSTA (referred to as the H-T amplitude relationship) in the Kuroshio{\textendash}Oyashio extension (KOE) region using both observational and reanalysis data. It is found that the spatial distribution of mesoscale SSHA variance is not coincident with mesoscale SSTA variance. The former peaks in the Kuroshio extension around 358N whereas the latter is strongest in the Oyashio extension around 408N. Regression analyses indicate that the rate of SSTA change per SSHA change is 1.88C m21 in the Kuroshio extension (1458{\textendash}1608E, 348{\textendash}368N) but increases drastically by a factor of 3{\textendash}4 to 6.28C m21 in the Oyashio extension (1458{\textendash}1608E, 398{\textendash}418N). A theoretical expression for the H-T amplitude relationship is derived. Analyzing this expression suggests that the stronger H-T amplitude relationship in the Oyashio extension than the Kuroshio extension is mainly attributed to 1) the smaller thermal expansion coefficient due to the colder background SST, 2) the stronger salinity compensation effect that works against the contribution of SSTA change to sea surface density anomaly (SSDA) change, and 3) the shallower vertical structure of mesoscale eddies. The second factor is ascribed to the strong surface salinity front in the Oyashio extension, while the third factor is found to be qualitatively consistent with the shallower baroclinically unstable modes due to the shallower density front there.},

Wake eddies and lee waves as small as 1 km were observed to form as these currents flowed around or over the steep topography. The direction and vertical structure of the incident flow varied over tidal, inertial, seasonal, and interannual timescales, with implications for downstream flow. Models incorporated tides and had grids with resolutions of hundreds of meters to enable predictions of flow transformations as waters encountered and passed around Palau's islands. In addition to making scientific advances, FLEAT had a positive impact on the local Palauan community by bringing new technology to explore local waters, expanding the country's scientific infrastructure, maintaining collaborations with Palauan partners, and conducting outreach activities aimed at elementary and high school students, US embassy personnel, and Palauan government officials.},

Methods of defining Southern Ocean spatial structures traditionally rely on somewhat ad hoc combinations of physical, chemical, and dynamic properties. As a step toward an alternative approach for describing spatial variability in temperature, here we apply an unsupervised classification technique (i.e., Gaussian mixture modeling or GMM) to Southern Ocean Argo float temperature profiles. GMM, without using any latitude or longitude information, automatically identifies several spatially coherent circumpolar classes influenced by the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. In addition, GMM identifies classes that bear the imprint of mode/intermediate water formation and export, large-scale gyre circulation, and the Agulhas Current, among others. Because GMM is robust, standardized, and automated, it can potentially be used to identify structures (such as fronts) in both observational and model data sets, possibly making it a useful complement to existing classification techniques.},

This ocean mesoscale turbulence is characterized by cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies (with a 100- to 300-km size and depth scales of {$\sim$}500{\textendash}1,000 m) that capture approximatively 80\% of the total kinetic energy and is now known to significantly impact the large-scale ocean circulation, the ocean's carbon storage, the air-sea interactions, and therefore the Earth climate as a whole. However, ocean mesoscale turbulence revealed by satellite observations has properties that differ from those related to classical geostrophic turbulence theories. In the last decade, a large number of theoretical and numerical studies has pointed to submesoscale surface fronts (1{\textendash}50 km), not resolved by satellite altimeters, as the key suspect explaining these discrepancies. Submesoscale surface fronts have been shown to impact mesoscale eddies and the large-scale ocean circulation in counterintuitive ways, leading in particular to up-gradient fluxes. The ocean engine is now known to involve energetic scale interactions, over a much broader range of scales than expected one decade ago, from 1 to 5,000 km. New space observations with higher spatial resolution are however needed to validate and improve these recent theoretical and numerical results.},

  abstract = {The transfer of Indian Ocean thermocline and intermediate waters into the South Atlantic via the Agulhas leakage is generally believed to be primarily accomplished through mesoscale eddy processes, essentially anticyclones known as Agulhas Rings. Here we take advantage of a recent eddy tracking algorithm and Argo float profiles to study the evolution and the thermohaline structure of one of these eddies over the course of 1.5 years (May 2013{\textendash}November 2014). We found that during this period the ring evolved according to two different phases: During the first one, taking place in winter, the mixing layer in the eddy deepened significantly. During the second phase, the eddy subsided below the upper warmer layer of the South Atlantic subtropical gyre while propagating west. The separation of this eddy from the sea surface could explain the decrease in its surface signature in satellite altimetry maps, suggesting that such changes are not due to eddy dissipation processes. It is a very large eddy (7.1{\texttimes}1013 m3 in volume), extending, after subduction, from a depth of 200{\textendash}1,200 m and characterized by two mode water cores. The two mode water cores represent the largest eddy heat and salt anomalies when compared with the surrounding. In terms of its impact over 1 year, the north-westward propagation of this long-lived anticyclone induces a transport of 2.2 Sv of water, 0.008 PW of heat, and 2.2{\texttimes}105 kg s-1 of salt. These results confirm that Agulhas Rings play a very important role in the Indo-Atlantic interocean exchange of heat and salt.},

  abstract = {Numerical study of ocean eddies has been carried out by using high-resolution ocean general circulation models. In order to understand ocean eddies from the large volume data produced by simulations, visualizing only eddy distribution at each time step is insufficient; time-variations in eddy events and phenomena must also be considered. However, existing methods cannot precisely find and track eddy events such as amalgamation and bifurcation. In this study, we propose an original approach for eddy detection, tracking, and event visualization based on an eddy classification system. The proposed method detects streams and currents as well as eddies, and it classifies discovered eddies into several categories using the additional stream and current information. By tracking how the classified eddies vary over time, detecting events such as eddy amalgamation and bifurcation as well as the interaction between eddies and ocean currents becomes achievable. We adopt the proposed method for two ocean areas in which strong ocean currents exist as case studies. We visualize the detected eddies and events in a time series of images, allowing us to acquire an intuitive understanding of a region of interest concealed in a high-resolution data set. Furthermore, our proposed method succeeded in clarifying the occurrence place and seasonality of each type of eddy event.},

In this brief article, a survey is presented of their primary characteristics and interpretive explanations, intended for a broad audience of physical and biogeochemical oceanographers. Besides their identifying scales, submesoscale currents are distinctive in their flow patterns, their essential dynamical processes, and their consequences for transport, mixing, and dissipation in the general circulation. There are two primary submesoscale populations, a frontal one in the nearsurface layer with its typically reduced stratification, and another vortical one, generated in topographic wakes, that (sparsely) fills the oceanic interior.},

  abstract = {We investigate impact of an island on hysteresis of a western boundary current (WBC) flowing across a gap using a nonlinear 1.5-layer ocean model. The results of hysteresis curves show the island in the middle of the gap facilitates the WBC intrusion. The inserted (removed) island in the middle of the gap promotes the WBC to shed eddy (leap across the gap) when the WBC path transits from the periodic penetrating (leaping) to the leaping (periodic penetrating) regime without (with) an island. Vorticity balance analysis reveals that the WBC transition from the eddy-shedding (leaping) to the leaping (eddy-shedding) regime is induced by increased (decreased) meridional advection. Moreover, the critical Reynolds number of the WBC at the Hopf bifurcation is not sensitive to the size and location of the island when the total gap width is fixed. The critical Reynolds number of the WBC translating from the eddy shedding to the leaping regime increases when either the total gap width increases or the island's meridional length increases; however, the critical Reynolds number is inversely proportional to the width of the southern gap with fixed total gap width and enlarged island length. The island promotes the WBC to shed eddy except when the island is near the northern barrier. The influence of an eastward-shifted island on the WBC transition from the eddy-shedding to the leaping regime is gradually reduced when the island is east of the Munk layer.},

We show that while 4{\textendash}5 times resolution scale is sufficient for each model resolution to reproduce the magnitude of satellite Earth Observation (EO) SST spatial variability to within {$\pm$}10\%, the representation of {$\sim$}100-km SST variability patterns is substantially (e.g., {$\sim$}50\% at 750 km) improved by increasing model resolution from 1{\textdegree} to 1/12{\textdegree}. We also analyzed the dominant scales of the SST model input drivers (short-wave radiation, air-sea heat fluxes, wind stress components, wind stress curl, and bathymetry) variability with the purpose of determining the optimal SST model input driver resolution. The SST magnitude of variability is shown to scale with two power law regimes separated by a scaling break at {$\sim$}200-km scale. The analysis of the spatial and temporal scales of dominant SST driver impact helps to interpret this scaling break as a separation between two different dynamical regimes: the (relatively) fast SST dynamics below {$\sim$}200 km governed by eddies, fronts, Ekman upwelling, and air-sea heat exchange, while above {$\sim$}200 km the SST variability is dominated by long-term (seasonal and supraseasonal) modes and the SST geography.},

  abstract = {Accurate observational estimation of the ocean surface heat, momentum, and freshwater fluxes is crucial for studies of the global climate system. Estimating surface flux using satellite remote sensing techniques is one possible answer to this challenge. In this paper, we introduce J-OFURO3, a third-generation data set developed by the Japanese Ocean Flux Data Sets with Use of Remote-Sensing Observations (J-OFURO) research project, which represents a significant improvement from older data sets as the result of research and development conducted from several perspectives. J-OFURO3 offers data sets for surface heat, momentum, freshwater fluxes, and related parameters over the global oceans (except regions of sea ice) from 1988 to 2013. The surface flux data, based on a 0.25{\textdegree} grid system, have a higher spatial resolution and are more accurate than the previous efforts. This has been achieved through the adopting of the state-of-the-art algorithms that estimate the near-surface air specific humidity and the improvement of techniques using observations from multi-satellite sensors. Comparisons with in situ observations using a systematic system developed along with the J-OFURO3 data set confirmed these improvements in accuracy, as did comparisons with other data sets. J-OFURO3 data are of good quality, facilitating a clearer understanding of more fine-scale ocean{\textendash}atmosphere features (such as ocean fronts, mesoscale eddies, and geographic features) and their effects on surface fluxes. The information contained in this long-term (26~year) data set is demonstrably beneficial to understanding climate change and its relationship to oceans and the atmosphere.},

Results from these studies have never been confirmed by observations in regional or basin-scale domains. Here we show that internal gravity waves have a spectral signature on sea surface height during summer that significantly differs from that of balanced motions. These spectral differences lead us to propose a new dynamical framework that quantifies the interactions between internal gravity waves and balanced motions in physical space from sea surface height snapshots, and in particular the energy exchanges between them. Our results, using this dynamical framework, highlight the strong potential of future satellite altimeter missions to make critical advances in assessing the ocean's kinetic energy budget from observations in large domains.},

The primary oceanographic objective is to characterize the ocean eddies at a spatial resolution of 15 km for 68\% of the ocean surface. This resolution is derived from the ratio between the wavenumber spectrum of the conventional altimeter (projected to submesoscale) and the SWOT SSH errors. While the 15-km threshold is useful as a global approximation of the spatial scales resolved by SWOT (SWOT scale), it can be misleading for regional studies. Here we revisit the problem using a high-resolution (;2-km horizontal grid spacing) tide-resolving global ocean simulation and map the SWOT scale as a function of location and season. The results show that the SWOT scale increases, in general, from about 15 km at low latitudes to ;30{\textendash}45 km at mid- and high latitudes but with a large geographical dependence. A SWOT scale smaller than 30 km is expected in the highlatitude energetic regions. The SWOT scale varies seasonally as a result of the seasonality in both the noise and ocean signals. The seasonality also has a geographical dependence. Both eddies and internal gravity waves/tides contribute significantly to the SWOT scale variation. Our analysis provides model predictions for interpreting the anticipated observations from SWOT and guidance for the development of analysis methodologies.},

This study examines the seasonal variations in eddy kinetic energy (EKE) of TIWs using in situ and satellite observations and elucidates the underlying dynamical mechanisms.

Because of the b effect and the surface wind divergence, the southerly winds generate anticyclonic wind curls north of the equator that intensify the sea surface temperature (SST) fronts and force the downwelling annual Rossby waves. The resultant sea surface height ridge induces strong horizontal current shears between 08 and 58N. The intensified current shears and SST fronts generate EKE via barotropic and baroclinic instabilities, respectively. To the extent that the seasonal migration of a northward-displaced intertropical convergence zone intensifies the southerly winds north of, but not south of, the equator, our study suggests that the climatic asymmetry is important for the oceanic eddy generations in the eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean{\textemdash}a result with important implications for coupled climate simulation/prediction.},

  abstract = {🔤通过考虑两次典型的海洋中尺度涡旋合并事件，研究了两个合并反气旋的最终状态是否比初始状态包含更多能量的长期理论``能量悖论''。结果表明，如果在涡旋围绕中心旋转时考虑相对于质心的轨道 AM，则总质量（体积）、总环流（涡量的面积积分）和总角动量 (AM) 是守恒的合并前的质量。对于地下合并，还应包括在地下涡流上方被泰勒-普劳德曼效应捕获的质量。循环和轨道 AM 的守恒定律在以前的理论研究中都被忽视了。由于合并过程中的融合，总涡动能略有下降。相反，合并后总涡流势能 (EPE) 增加。 EPE 的增加主要是由于在合并前涡流下沉低于原始水平而导致的重力势能 (PE) 损失。这意味着涡流的合并需要将背景引力 PE 转换为 EPE。相反，涡度和熵在合并后因此减少。因此，涡流合并效应表现为反向能量级联中的``大型能量泵''。要注意的是，涡守恒和转换定律取决于物理动力学定律，即使可以在数学模型中提供额外的自由度。 The long-term theoretical ``energy paradox'' of whether the final state of two merging anticyclones contains more energy than the initial state is studied by considering two typical merging events of ocean mesoscale eddies. The results demonstrate that the total mass (volume), total circulation (area integration of vorticity), and total angular momentum (AM) are conserved if the orbital AM relative to the center of mass is taken into account as the eddies rotate around the center of mass before merging. For subsurface merging, the mass trapped by the Taylor{\textendash}Proudman effect above the subsurface eddies should also be included. Both conservation laws of circulation and orbital AM have been overlooked in previous theoretical studies. As a result of fusion during merging, the total eddy kinetic energy decreases slightly. In contrast, the total eddy potential energy (EPE) increases after merging. The increase in EPE is mostly supported by the loss of gravitational potential energy (PE) via eddy sinking below the original level prior to merging. This implies that the merging of eddies requires background gravitational PE to be converted to EPE. In contrast, the vorticity and enstrophy consequently decrease after merging. Thus, the eddy merging effect behaves as a ``large-scale energy pump'' in an inverse energy cascade. It is noted that eddy conservation and conversion laws depend on the laws of physical dynamics, even if additional degrees of freedom can be provided in a mathematical model.},

(Geophys Res Lett 45:9042{\textendash}9048, 2018). Here we revisit this topic and focus on the seasonal variability and shifts of the OE fronts from 1982 to 2018, with observational reanalysis data and a 1.5-layer reduced-gravity model simulation. In winter, both the western and eastern OE fronts demonstrate consistent northward movement. While in summer, the eastern OE front still moves northward but the western OE front has no obvious and even southward shift. It is shown that the trade wind's expansion during 1982{\textendash}2018 favours the northward shift of the OE fronts for both winter and summer. However, there is a local cold Ekman heat transport anomaly along the western OE front in summer, which surpasses the effect of trade wind expansion and prohibits northward movement of the front. This cold Ekman advection is due to a westerly wind anomaly induced firstly by the Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation (AMO) and secondly by the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). In winter, the local Ekman heat transport is less effective than in summer in changing the OE front position because of the deep mixed layer. Our study demonstrates the seasonality of the OE front shift and highlights the importance of local Ekman heat transport associated with the AMO. Our results also partly explain the rainfall changes in both winter and summer in the western Pacific Ocean in the past 37 years, since the rainband east of Japan is affected by the sea surface temperature and its front.},

  abstract = {Satellite altimetry data and high-resolution model output are used to investigate the mechanism of interannual variations of the solitary meander in the Agulhas Current, called the Natal Pulse. It is shown that most of the Natal Pulses are triggered by anticyclonic eddies originating from the Southeast Madagascar Current (SEMC) and anticyclonic eddies of the Mozambique Channel are the secondary source. In addition to the barotropic conversion suggested by previous studies, the advection of eddy kinetic energy (EKE) plays a statistically significant role in the growth of the Natal Pulse. The number of anticyclonic eddies arriving at the Natal Bight largely explains the interannual variations in the Natal Pulse. The barotropic conversion from the SEMC, whose interannual variations are likely related to the remote wind forcing, is the main EKE source and corresponds well with the interannual variations of anticyclonic eddies generated off the southern coast of Madagascar. It is also shown that the interannual variations of the Natal Pulse are linked to large-scale wind variability in the southern Indian Ocean. Plain Language Summary Natal Pulse is the large meander of the Agulhas Current originating in the Natal Bight and it affects both the local marine environment and global ocean circulation. Previous observational studies suggested that the occurrence of the Natal Pulse varies from year-to-year. Since oceanic eddies tend to trigger the Natal Pulse, we investigate the relationship between the Natal Pulse and incoming eddies in this study. We show that variations of the Natal Pulse are mainly explained by variations of eddies propagating from the south of Madagascar and the Mozambique Channel. We also show that variations in the Natal Pulse are linked to the large-scale wind variability over the southern Indian Ocean. This study is the first to show the mechanism of the year-to-year variations in the Natal Pulse.},

  abstract = {Upper-ocean seasonal stratification (seasonal pycnocline and/or transition layer) is a ubiquitous feature and its vertical structure has large spatial variability. The density stratification regulates the stability of the upper ocean and thus can affect the oceanic response to atmospheric forcing and biogeochemical processes by modulating vertical mixing. In this study, we described the development of the seasonal stratification in terms of the stability of the water column, using the potential energy anomaly (PEA) as a metric based on Argo profiles. PEA budget analysis reveals that over most of the North Pacific, seasonal stratification develops under a vertical one-dimensional energy balance between an increase in PEA (i.e., a strengthening of the stratification) driven by atmospheric buoyancy forcing and a decrease in PEA associated with vertical mixing within the water column. Horizontal advection of PEA plays a significant role in the seasonal development of the stratification only in the regions of the western boundary current and equatorial current system south of 10{\textdegree}N. We find that, in addition to the total magnitude of the oceanic buoyancy gain, the balance between compositions of the atmospheric forcing (non-penetrating surface buoyancy forcing and penetrating radiative heating) is also important in explaining regional differences in the development of the seasonal stratification. The vertical diffusivity in the seasonal stratification estimated from the residual of the PEA budget is in the range from 5\,{\texttimes}\,10-5 m2 s-1 to 5\,{\texttimes}\,10-4 m2 s-1 and shows spatial and seasonal variability associated with local wind forcing.},

Both the air{\textendash}sea heat flux and wind stress act as eddy killers that remove energy from oceanic eddies. Heat exchange between atmosphere and oceanic eddies dominates the dissipation of eddy temperature variance within the surface layer and accounts for 36\% of the total dissipation in the upper 350-m layer. Compared to the heat exchange, the role of wind power in damping the eddy kinetic energy (EKE) is relatively small. Only 18\% of EKE dissipation in the upper 350 m is attributed to eddy wind power. Misrepresentation of the damping role of mesoscale ocean{\textendash}atmosphere interaction can result in an incorrect vertical structure of eddy energy dissipation, leading to an erroneous representation of vertical mixing in the interior ocean.},

However, the observational evidence for this restratifying process has been lacking due to the difficulty in measuring such ephemeral phenomena, particularly over periods of months to years. This study presents an annual cycle of the vertical velocity and associated restratification estimated from two nested clusters of meso- and submesoscale-resolving moorings, deployed in a typical midocean area of the northeast Atlantic. Vertical velocities inferred using the nondiffusive density equation are substantially stronger at submesoscales (horizontal scales of 1{\textendash}10 km) than at mesoscales (horizontal scales of 10{\textendash}100 km), with respective root-mean-square values of 38.0 {$\pm$} 6.9 and 22.5 {$\pm$} 3.3 m day               -1               . The largest submesoscale vertical velocities and rates of restratification occur in events of a few days' duration in winter and spring, and extend down to at least 200 m below the mixed layer base. These events commonly coincide with the enhancement of submesoscale lateral buoyancy gradients, which is itself associated with persistent mesoscale frontogenesis. This suggests that mesoscale frontogenesis is a regular precursor of the submesoscale turbulence that restratifies the upper ocean. The upper-ocean restratification induced by submesoscale motions integrated over the annual cycle is comparable in magnitude to the net destratification driven by local atmospheric cooling, indicating that submesoscale flows play a significant role in determining the climatological upper-ocean stratification in the study area.},

Comparatively, the knowledge of the three-dimensional (3D) structure of mesoscale eddies is scarce, especially in the open ocean. In the present study, high-resolution field observations of a cyclonic eddy in the Kuroshio Extension have been carried out and the anatomy of the observed eddy is conducted. The temperature anomaly exhibits a vertical monopole cone structure with a maximum of -7.3 {$\smwhtcircle$}C located in the main thermocline. The salinity anomaly shows a vertical dipole structure with a fresh anomaly in the main thermocline and a saline anomaly in the North Pacific Intermediate Water (NPIW). The cyclonic flow displays an equivalent barotropic structure. The mixed layer is deep in the center of the eddy and thin in the periphery. The seasonal thermocline is intensified and the permanent thermocline is upward domed by 350 m. The subtropical mode water (STMW) straddled between the seasonal and permanent thermoclines weakens and dissipates in the eddy center. The salinity of NPIW distributed along the isopycnals shows no significant difference inside and outside the eddy. The geostrophic relation is approximately set up in the eddy. The nonlinearity{\textemdash}defined as the ratio between the rotational speed to the translational speed{\textemdash}is 12.5 and decreases with depth. The eddy-wind interaction is examined by high resolution satellite observations. The results show that the cold eddy induces wind stress aloft with positive divergence and negative curl. The wind induced upwelling process is responsible for the formation of the horizontal monopole pattern of salinity, while the horizontal transport results in the horizontal dipole structure of temperature in the mixed layer.},

The first method is based on performing 16 PCHIPs on 8 rotated versions of the plot of the data versus an independent variable (such as pressure or time). These 16 PCHIPs are then used to form 8 interpolations of the original data, and finally, these 8 are averaged. When the original data are unevenly spaced with respect to the independent variable, we show that it is best to perform the Multiply-Rotated PCHIP (MR-PCHIP) method using the ``data index'' as the independent variable, and then to subsequently perform one last PCHIP of the data index with respect to the original independent variable. This MR-PCHIP method avoids the flat spots that are a feature of the PCHIP method when the data have multiple values approximately equal to a local extreme value. The MR-PCHIP interpolated data have continuous first derivatives at the data points. This method also avoids the unrealistic overshoots that can occur when using the standard cubic spline interpolation procedure. The second interpolation method is designed specifically for hydrographic data with the aim of minimizing the formation of unrealistic water masses by the interpolation procedure. This is achieved by applying a Piecewise Cubic Hermite Interpolating Polynomial to each of 8 rotations of the salinity versus temperature plot (Multiply-Rotated Salinity{\textendash}Temperature PCHIP, MRST-PCHIP) with bottle number (that is, data index) as the vertical interpolating coordinate, thereby making the MRST-PCHIP method independent of the heave of a water column. This method is equivalent to interpolating in the salinity{\textendash}temperature diagram, and MRST-PCHIP proves very effective at avoiding the production of anomalous water masses that otherwise occur when interpolating temperature and salinity separately.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

A high-resolution configuration of the Community Earth System Model version 1.3 (CESM1.3) is used for the simulations with a nominal horizontal resolution of 0.25{\textdegree} for the atmosphere and land models and 0.1{\textdegree} for the ocean and sea-ice models. At these resolutions, the model permits tropical cyclones and ocean mesoscale eddies, allowing interactions between these synoptic and mesoscale phenomena with large-scale circulations. An overview of the results from these simulations is provided with a focus on model drift, mean climate, internal modes of variability, representation of the historical and future climates, and extreme events. Comparisons are made to solutions from an identical set of simulations using the standard resolution (nominal 1{\textdegree}) CESM1.3 and to available observations for the historical period to address some key scientific questions concerning the impact and benefit of increasing model horizontal resolution in climate simulations. An emerging prominent feature of the high-resolution pre-industrial simulation is the intermittent occurrence of polynyas in the Weddell Sea and its interaction with an Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation. Overall, high-resolution simulations show significant improvements in representing global mean temperature changes, seasonal cycle of sea-surface temperature and mixed layer depth, extreme events and in relationships between extreme events and climate modes.},

It is found that the cyclonic (anticyclonic) rings presented consistent negative (positive) anomalies of potential temperature; meanwhile the relevant maximum anomaly center became increasingly shallow for the cyclonic rings whereas it went deeper for the anticyclonic rings as the potential temperature anomaly decreased from the west to the east. The above deepening or shoaling trend is associated with the zonal change of the depth of the main thermocline. Moreover, the composite cold ring between 140{\textdegree} and 150{\textdegree}E was found to exhibit a double-core vertical structure due to the existence of mode water with low potential vorticity. Specifically, a relatively large negative (positive) salinity anomaly and a small positive (negative) one appeared for the composite cyclonic (anticyclonic) ring at the depth above and below 600 m, respectively. The underlying driving force for the temperature and salinity anomaly of the composite rings was also attempted, which varies depending on the intensity of the background current and the temperature and salinity fields in different areas of the KE region, and the rings' influences on the temperature and salinity could reach deeper than 1 000 m on average.},

Eddy kinetic energy (EKE), derived from time-dependent circulation, is commonly used to study mesoscale eddies. However, there are three deficiencies of EKE when focusing on the analysis of coherent mesoscale eddies. Here, we propose a comprehensive concept{\textemdash}Lagrangian EKE (LEKE) as an additional metric which is a combination of gridded EKE calculated in Eulerian framework and tracked coherent mesoscale eddies in Lagrangian framework. Evidences suggest that LEKE can make up these deficiencies as an effective supplement. In this study, regional application over Northwestern Pacific Ocean is taken as an example. It clearly demonstrates that LEKE reveals more accurate and detailed characteristics of both cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies than EKE when coherent mesoscale eddies are the specific focus, such as the variation rates of kinetic energy during the eddy propagation, spatial{\textendash}temporal differences of kinetic energy between cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies. Overall, using LEKE to analyze coherent mesoscale eddies gives the rise to understand the spatial{\textendash}temporal contrasts between eddies with different polarities, and provides a new perspective to recognize the crucial role played by coherent mesoscale eddies in the ocean.},

Using an industry-leading oil spill model, we compare forecasts of oil dispersion when forced with two different hydrodynamic models of the North-West European Shelf (7~km and 1.5~km horizontal resolution). This demonstrates how the trajectory of a deep water ({$>$}1000~m) release in the central Faroe-Shetland Channel is influenced by explicitly resolving mesoscale processes. The finer resolution hydrodynamic model dramatically enhances the horizontal dispersion of oil and transports pollutant further afield. This is a consequence of higher mesoscale variability. Stratification influences the depth of subsurface plume trapping and subsequently the far-field transport of oil. These results demonstrate that the choice of hydrodynamic model resolution is crucial when designing particle tracking or tracer release experiments.},

  abstract = {The signatures of mesoscale eddies induced surface and subsurface changes have not been comprehensively quantified for the Bay of Bengal (BoB) region. This study quantifies the statistical properties and three-dimensional (3D) eddy structures in the BoB. To accomplish this, the satellite altimetry data combined with automated eddy detection and tracking algorithm is used. Horizontal distribution of surface characteristics of eddies is analyzed by using 24 years (1993{\textendash}2016) of AVHRR infrared satellite sea surface temperature (SST) and 7 years (2010{\textendash}2016) of sea surface salinity (SSS) of SMOS satellite data. Surface eddy centric composite analysis reveals the existence of warm (cold) and diverse SSS anomalies for anticyclonic (cyclonic) eddies. During winter, it is important to note that the eddy induced SST and SSS anomalies show the dipole patterns show opposite phases for the cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies. Observed diploe structures are consistent with the eddy rotation and background large-scale meridional gradient of temperature and salinity fields. The 3D structure of eddies is investigated by using the ARMOR3D and Argo float profiles. The horizontal distribution of temperature and salinity anomalies from ARMOR3D signify the monopole structure of eddies in the subsurface layers. Further, the analysis of composite averages of 241 (200) Argo temperature profiles indicates the core of anticyclonic (cyclonic) eddies centered at about {$\sim$}140 m ({$\sim$}100 m). However, salinity profiles depict the existence of core at {$\sim$}65 m ({$\sim$}50 m). This study have practical relevance to a variety of stakeholders and finds profound importance in the validation of eddy-resolving ocean models for the BoB region.},

  abstract = {Variability in the El Ni{\~n}o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) has global impacts on seasonal temperatures and rainfall. Current detection methods for extreme phases, which occur with irregular periodicity, rely upon sea surface temperature anomalies within a strictly defined geographic region of the Pacific Ocean. However, under changing climate conditions and ocean warming, these historically motivated indicators may not be reliable into the future. In this work, we demonstrate the power of data clustering as a robust, automatic way to detect anomalies in climate patterns. Ocean temperature profiles from Argo floats are partitioned into similar groups utilizing unsupervised machine learning methods. The automatically identified groups of measurements represent spatially coherent, large-scale water masses in the Pacific, despite no inclusion of geospatial information in the clustering task. Further, spatiotemporal dynamics of the clusters are strongly indicative of El Ni{\~n}o events, the east Pacific warming phase of ENSO. The fitting of a cluster model on a collection of ocean profiles identifies changes in the vertical structure of the temperature profiles through reassignment to a different group, concisely capturing physical changes to the water column during an El Ni{\~n}o event, such as thermocline tilting. Clustering proves to be an effective tool for analysis of the irregularly sampled (in space and time) data from Argo floats and may serve as a novel approach for detecting anomalies given the freedom from thresholding decisions. Unsupervised machine learning could be particularly valuable due to its ability to identify patterns in data sets without user-imposed expectations, facilitating further discovery of anomaly indicators.},

However, it remains unclear how the surface heat reservoir is replenished by ocean processes to sustain the atmospheric heat uptake. Using high-resolution climate simulations, we find that the vertical heat transport by ocean mesoscale eddies acts as an important heat supplier to the surface ocean in frontal regions. This vertical eddy heat transport is not accounted for by the prevailing inviscid and adiabatic ocean dynamical theories such as baroclinic instability and frontogenesis but is tightly related to the atmospheric forcing. Strong surface cooling associated with intense winds in winter promotes turbulent mixing in the mixed layer, destructing the vertical shear of mesoscale eddies. The restoring of vertical shear induces an ageostrophic secondary circulation transporting heat from the subsurface to surface ocean.},

  abstract = {Abstract Submesoscale density fronts and the associated processes of frontogenesis and symmetric instability (SI) are investigated in the northwest Pacific subtropical countercurrent (STCC) system by a high-resolution simulation and diagnostic analysis. Both satellite observations and realistic simulation show active surface fronts with a horizontal scale of {\textasciitilde}20 km in the STCC upper ocean. Frontogenesis-induced buoyancy advection is detected to rapidly sharpen these density fronts. The direct straining effect of larger-scale geostrophic flows is a primary influence on the buoyancy-gradient frontogenetic tendency and frontal baroclinic potential vorticity (PV) enhancement. The enhanced lateral buoyancy gradients in conjunction with atmospheric forced surface buoyancy loss can produce a negative Ertel PV and trigger frontal SI in the STCC region. Up to 30\% of the mixed layer (ML) inside a typical eddy has negative PV in the high-resolution simulation. As a result, the cross-front ageostrophic secondary circulations tend to restratify the surface boundary layer and induce a large vertical velocity reaching {\textasciitilde}100 m day-1, substantially facilitating the vertical communication of the STCC system. At the same time, the SI is identified to be responsible for a forward cascade of geostrophic kinetic energy in the STCC region, despite the coexistence of ML eddies and SI in the deep winter ML. Therefore, these active density fronts and their SI-associated submesoscale processes play important roles in the enhanced vertical exchanges (e.g., heat, nutrients, and carbon) and energy transfer to smaller scales in the eddy-active STCC upper ocean, as well as triggering phytoplankton blooms at the periphery of eddies.},

The eddy-current effects are known since the 1930ies, and just the experiments ``Polygon-67'' in the Arabian Sea, ``Polygon-70'', MODE, POLYMODE, Tourbillon, ``Mesopolygon'' in the tropical Atlantic, ``Megapolygon'' in the northwestern Pacific Ocean have advanced our knowledge about physical nature of the ocean eddy dynamics. Long-term complex measurements including current meters at the moored buoy arrays accompanied by a series of hydrographic surveys have provided the required experimental data for developing the theory of mesoscale variability. It explained arising and evolution of the eddies in the ocean as a result of interaction between various physical processes: baroclinic instability of a large-scale current, transformation of geostrophic turbulence in the Rossby wave field, barotropization of eddies and others. Later on, the studies of the ocean mesoscale variability evolved from the oceanographic surveys and special-purpose experiments at the polygons performed due to the research vessel cruises to the satellite altimetry methods and the drifter technologies. All the modern global estimates of eddy formations published in the last decade confirm the previous summaries, particularly those describing spatial distribution of the eddy kinetic energy in the World Ocean. They also represent new or the improved assessments of the eddies' various characteristics: their size, drift velocity and direction, sign of rotation, nonlinearity, trajectory shear and others. Despite of the progress in remote sensing and regular launching of great amount of drifters and profiling floats, it is still difficult to obtain a comprehensive pattern of eddy dynamics within the whole World Ocean. It seems perspective to resume in future special-purpose experiments in the key regions of the World Ocean based on modern technologies.},

  abstract = {The Agulhas leakage of Indian Ocean waters into the Atlantic has been shown to be a key link in global ocean circulation and climate; an increased understanding of this process is therefore of more than just of local interest. While knowledge of the Agulhas leakage has increased over the past 30 years, the precise mechanisms at play and water properties transferred are still not sufficiently documented. This study covers the Agulhas rings heat content and transport, which contribute to the meridional overturning circulation of the global ocean during their route across the South Atlantic Ocean. By applying TOEddies, an eddy detection and tracking algorithm that takes into account eddy merging and splitting, to satellite altimetry maps combined with a colocation of the detected eddies with Argo floats vertical profiles, we are able to document the important heat anomaly characterizing Agulhas rings and their evolution across the Cape Basin and the South Atlantic Ocean. Notwithstanding that in situ data coverage is still limited at the ocean mesoscale, we have estimated an averaged Agulhas rings subsurface heat transport of 2.5 {\texttimes} 10-2 PW and 1.5 {\texttimes} 10-2 PW across the eastern and western South Atlantic Ocean, respectively. Plain Language Summary Mesoscale eddies are ubiquitous structures in the ocean. By containing more than half of the kinetic energy of the ocean circulation, they clearly shape it. They are also suspected to play a crucial role in transporting and mixing heat, salt, chemicals, and other materials within and among ocean basins. Because of this, they are alleged to impact the Earth climate and its changes. This should be true, in particular, south of Africa where the largest mesoscales eddies, the so-called Agulhas rings, are shed from the Agulhas Current into the Cape Basin conveying Indian warm and salty waters into the southeast Atlantic Ocean. However, due to their small-scale and highly variable nature, ocean eddies are inadequately sampled and poorly reproduced in numerical models. By using an eddy atlas built on satellite altimetry and associated to subsurface in situ observations acquired by the Argo profiling floats international program, we present new estimate of the role of Agulhas rings in advecting large quantity of heat across the South Atlantic basin. The results of our study are crucial to improve the understanding and modeling of ocean dynamics and the Earth climate.},

  abstract = {Mesoscale eddies dominate the majority of oceanic kinetic energy. The size of eddies is one of the basic properties; however, little is known about it because of lack of observations. Especially, their global vertical extent has still not been well investigated. Here, a ratio relationship of height to length scale for an eddy is derived based on dynamical constraints. Global satellite altimetry data combined with Argo float observations are used to calculate the aspect ratios of mesoscale eddies in the global ocean, and then their vertical scale is inferred. Approximately 25\% of the total identified eddies with lifetimes {$\geq$}16 weeks from January 2002 to December 2017 trapped at least an Argo float near the eddy center. The result shows that the size of eddies has an obvious latitudinal dependence. Eddies at middle-low latitudes tend to be ``large and shallow'' with small aspect ratios, and eddies at high latitudes tend to be ``small and deep{\textendash} reaching'' with large aspect ratios. Such results are coarsely considered as a competition between rotation and stratification. Eddy aspect ratios in middle-high-latitude regions show enhanced variance compared to those in low-latitude regions. More than half of eddies have a vertical extent smaller than 400 m. The majority of eddies extend over the mixed layer depth and are instead situated in the pycnocline. Some eddies at the middle-high latitudes penetrate through the entire pycnocline and reach deep ocean; as such, these eddies may play an important role in linking the deep-sea circulations and the surface circulations.},

Theoretical schemes of the influencing mechanisms, which are illustrated by the examples of such an impact on the plankton in the Black Sea, are examined. The analyzed responses of the marine plankton ecosystems to the eddy dynamics and the scientific literature review unambiguously testify the important role of these processes in formation of biological productivity in the seas and oceans. A cyclonic eddy forms the isopycnals rise (a dome-like bend) in its core both in the thermocline and in the pycno-halocline that elevates nitrocline; it promotes bioproductivity increase. In the center of the anticyclonic eddy, the thermocline and pycno-halocline deepen (deflection) which negatively affects bioproductivity. At the same time, the rise of the isopycnals occurs at the eddy periphery that, on the contrary, contributes to increase in primary production. In contrast to a regular anticyclone, a water-body (or lens-like) eddy induces the water rise in a layer above the depth of the maximum orbital velocity of the eddy, in other words, in its upper part it often acts like a cyclone. Thus, in any eddy there are the areas where the thermocline rises to the surface and, therefore, the prerequisites for the bioproductivity increase are formed. Strong winds not only enhance the effect of the eddies on biota, but can completely change the nature of this impact. When exposed to wind, the intensity of the biogenic elements transport to the photic layer in the cyclones can decrease, whereas in the lens-like anticyclones it can increase. The important point is that the long-living eddies change the influencing mechanisms depending on the stage of their evolution. At last, the eddy structures often promote changing in the dominant phytoplankton species that can significantly alter the flow of organic matter to the bottom and affect the global carbon cycle.},

  abstract = {Until now, mesoscale oceanic eddies have been automatically detected through physical methods on satellite altimetry. Nevertheless, they often have a visible signature on Sea Surface Temperature (SST) satellite images, which have not been yet sufficiently exploited. We introduce a novel method that employs Deep Learning to detect eddy signatures on such input. We provide the first available dataset for this task, retaining SST images through altimetric-based region proposal. We train a CNN-based classifier which succeeds in accurately detecting eddy signatures in well-defined examples. Our experiments show that the difficulty of classifying a large set of automatically retained images can be tackled by training on a smaller subset of manually labeled data. The difference in performance on the two sets is explained by the noisy automatic labeling and intrinsic complexity of the SST signal. This approach can provide to oceanographers a tool for validation of altimetric eddy detection through SST.},

In the 41{\textdegree} N section traversing the meandering subarctic front, the denser variety of CMW (D-CMW) and TRMW was formed continuously on both sides of the front, except for the part of the section located south of the Kuroshio bifurcation front where the lighter variety of CMW (L-CMW) and D-CMW was formed instead. L-CMW and D-CMW were also formed in the eastern part of the 37.5{\textdegree} N section between the Kuroshio Extension front and the Kuroshio bifurcation front, but were hardly formed in the western part of the section west of the bifurcation point of the two fronts. D-CMW and TRMW pycnostads in the western part of the 41{\textdegree} N section observed in April 2013 tended to exhibit more than one core (vertical minimum of potential vorticity), which might be formed by destruction of deep winter mixed layers. Such multiplecore structure was also observed in L-CMW and D-CMW pycnostads in the eastern part of both the sections south of the Kuroshio bifurcation front in June 2016, being particularly abundant in three anticyclonic eddies. It was likely to be formed by the exchange of low-potential vorticity water among the eddies and the ambient region in association with eddy-to-eddy interaction, suggesting a new mechanism of mode water subduction.},

By decomposing w with an omega equation of the primitive equation system and by taking into account the measurement design of the SWOT mission, this study seeks to reconstruct the subinertial, balanced w and z signals. By adopting the effective surface quasigeostrophic (eSQG) framework and applying to the Kuroshio Extension region of the North Pacific, we find that the target and reconstructed fields have a spatial correlation of ;0.7 below the mixed layer for w and 0.7{\textendash}0.9 throughout the 1000-m upper ocean for z in the error-free scenario. By taking the SWOT sampling and measurement errors into account, the spatial correlation is found to decrease to 0.4{\textendash}0.6 below the mixed layer for w and 0.6{\textendash}0.7 for z, respectively. For both w and z reconstruction, the degradation due to the SWOT errors is more significant in the surface layer and for smaller-scale signals.

This dominance of decadal variations is controlled by the negative feedback loop involving the wind-forced KE variability and its feedback onto the overlying extratropical storm tracks and the basin-scale surface wind field. The wind-forced decadal KE modulations were disrupted in August 2017 due to the development of the Kuroshio large meander south of Japan. By forcing the inflow KE paths northward and by avoiding overriding the shallow Izu Ridge, the Kuroshio large meander was able to compel the KE to change rapidly from the wind-forced, pre-existing, unstable state to a stable state. Following the large meander occurrence in late 2017, the stabilized KE change is found to affect the overlying storm tracks and the basin-scale wind field the same way as those generated by the wind-forced KE change prior to 2017. Given the consistent atmospheric response to both the large-meander-induced and wind-forced KE variability, we expect that the KE dynamic state will resume its decadal modulation after the phase reset relating to the 2017 large meander event.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

  abstract = {The Southern Ocean (SO) is one of the most energetic regions in the world, where strong air-sea fluxes, oceanic instabilities, and flow-topography interactions yield complex dynamics. The Kerguelen Plateau (KP) region in the Indian sector of the SO is a hot spot for these energetic dynamics, which result in large spatiotemporal variability of physical and biogeochemical properties throughout the water column. Data from Argo floats (including biogeochemical) are used to investigate the spatial variability of intermediate and deep water physical and biogeochemical properties. An unsupervised machine learning classification approach is used to organize the float profiles into five SO frontal zones based on their temperature and salinity structure between 300 and 900 m, revealing not only the location of frontal zones and their boundaries but also the variability of water mass properties relative to the zonal mean state. We find that the variability is property dependent and can be more than twice as large as the mean zonal variability in intense eddy fields. In particular, we observe this intense variability in the intermediate and deep waters of the Subtropical Zone; in the Subantarctic Zone just west of and at KP; east of KP in the Polar Frontal Zone, associated with intense eddy variability that enhances deep waters convergence and mixing; and, as the deep waters upwell to the upper 500 m and mix with the surface waters in the southernmost regimes, each property shows a large variability.},

  abstract = {The outputs from a submesoscale permitting hindcast simulation from 1990 to 2016 are used to investigate the interannual to decadal variations of submesoscale motions. The region we focus on is the subtropical Northwestern Pacific including the subtropical countercurrent. The submesoscale kinetic energy (KE) is characterized by strong interannual and decadal variability, displaying larger magnitudes in 1996, 2003, and 2015, and smaller magnitudes in 1999, 2009, 2010, and 2016. These variations are partially explained by those of the available potential energy (APE) release at submesoscale driven by mixed layer instability in winter. Indeed, this APE release depends on the mixed layer depth and horizontal buoyancy gradient, both of them modulated with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). As a result of the inverse KE cascade, the submesoscale KE variability possibly leads to interannual to decadal variations of the mesoscale KE (eddy KE (EKE)). These results show that submesoscale motions are a possible pathway to explain the impact associated with the PDO on the decadal EKE variability. The winter APE release estimated from the Argo float observations varies synchronously with that in the simulation on the interannual time scales, which suggests the observation capability to diagnose the submesoscale KE variability.},

  abstract = {Mesoscale eddies have been shown to have significant effects on biogeochemical cycles, as observed in local levels of near-surface chlorophyll. There are many regional differences in the expected response of near-surface chlorophyll to the presence of eddies, caused by differences in the driving mechanisms. However, in many high eddy activity areas, previous studies found low correlation and an inconsistent chlorophyll anomaly response to the presence of eddies. One such area is in the South Pacific Subtropical Countercurrent. Using GlobColour ocean color data and Aviso altimetry data, an investigation of the area found that a seasonal reversal occurs in the character of the chlorophyll anomaly within eddies (reversal from positive to negative and vice versa). The cause of this reversal is inferred to be a seasonally changing limiting factor within the region. Argo float profiles colocated inside and outside of eddies are used to show the coincidence of chlorophyll anomalies with seasonally changing mixed layer depths and the ability of the eddies to access deep nutrient pools. Observations of other mechanisms, such as eddy stirring or eddy-Ekman pumping, are found to be seasonally less important than the mixed layer depth change-induced nutrient flux . Additionally, metrics are developed to globally identify oceanic regions in which such seasonal reversals in chlorophyll anomalies could occur.},

  abstract = {Argo float trajectory data has been used to estimate the velocities of mid-depth (1000 db) currents in the North Indian Ocean (NIO). The structure of the upper ocean absolute geostrophic currents can be derived more accurately from the Argo temperature and salinity profiles by referring to the estimated velocities rather than by assuming a level of ``no motion''. The derived flow field reveals that the eastward zonal velocities generate striation-like structures in the Arabian Sea, which is most prominent above the layer of 500 db layer, with a meridional scale of {\textasciitilde}300 km; however, such structures are barely observed in the Bay of Bengal. This meridional scale as well as the distribution of the mid-depth striations are unique to the NIO, as compared with the other ocean basins. The nonlinear 1 12-layer reduced-gravity model combined with the triad baroclinic Rossby wave interaction theory have been used to determine the essential factors controlling the characteristics of the quasizonal striation structure. Compared with the North Pacific Ocean, the meridional scale in the NIO is narrower, and is caused by the smaller basin size in the equatorial zone, rather than by the semiannual wind stress forcing period or the eastern boundary angle. Furthermore, the coastal trapped Kelvin waves significantly contribute to the generation of the zonal striations in the Arabian Sea.},

We found that substantial dissipation of eddies, with a strong bias toward dissipation of anticyclonic eddies, is directly linked to TC activity. East of Taiwan, where TCs show a remarkable intensifying trend in recent decades, the ocean exhibits a corresponding upward trend of positive PV anomalies. Carried westward by eddies, increasing numbers of positive PV anomalies impinge on the Kuroshio current, causing the mean current to accelerate downstream. This acts in opposition to decreasing basin-scale wind stress and has a potentially important warming impact on the extratropical ocean and climate.},

  abstract = {Oceanic submesoscale processes (with scales {\textasciitilde}1{\textendash}10 km and approximately days) have been progressively recognized as an important upwelling mechanism to close the upper ocean nutrient budget and sustain the primary production in euphotic layer. Spiral band is one of the most typical submesoscale structures of mesoscale eddies, characterized with enhancement of surface chlorophyll concentration. By combining satellite ocean-color, satellite-altimetry, and surface drifter data, we find that the oceanic spiral chlorophyll bands emerge globally and share a series of structural and kinematic features with atmospheric spiral rain bands of tropical cyclones, which indicate that they are footprints of the vertical motions induced by vortex Rossby waves embedded in eddies. As vortex Rossby waves are closely related to eddy evolution under background deformation, further observational analysis indicates that an intense eddy energy variation and a strong background deformation field constitute the favorable conditions for the emergence of the spiral chlorophyll bands. Plain Language Summary Oceanic mesoscale eddies are energetic vortices with radius ranging from tens to hundreds of kilometers. Spiral band (with scales {\textasciitilde}1{\textendash}10 km and approximately days) is a common submesoscale feature of mesoscale eddies, characterized by enhanced surface chlorophyll concentrations. This submesoscale process serves as an important upwelling mechanism to close the upper ocean nutrient budget and sustain the primary production of phytoplankton in euphotic layer, but their dynamical origin is not fully understood so far. In this study, we combine global satellite ocean-color data, ocean surface drifter measurements, and satellite altimeter data to demonstrate that the spiral bands are footprints of wave motions embedded in oceanic eddies, rather than simple tracer lines elongated by the straining flow field. The spiral's azimuthal moving velocity is substantially smaller than the eddy's rotational velocity and the spiral tends to move outward from eddy center to eddy edge. These features are also identified in the atmospheric spiral rain bands of tropical cyclones, which are induced by vortex Rossby waves and can cause strong vertical motions. The enhanced surface chlorophyll signals observed along the spiral bands are likely caused by vortex Rossby waves embedded in the ocean eddies.},

To investigate potential pathways and variability of mCDW, 3809 CTD profiles (instrumented seal and ship-based data) are classified using a machine learning approach (Profile Classification Model). Five vertical regimes are identified, and areas of larger variability highlighted. Three spatial regimes are captured: Off-Shelf, Eastern and Central Troughs. The on-shelf profiles further show a separation between cold and warm modes. The variability is higher north of Burke Island and at the southern end of the Eastern Trough, which reflects the convergence of different mCDW pathways between the Eastern and the Central Trough. Finally, a clear but variable clockwise circulation is identified in Pine Island Bay.},

Assuming that the geometry and properties of an oceanic eddy are orientation-sensitive, an angularly aligned composite analysis of over 40 million eddy-focused surface topographic ``snapshots'' obtained by merging tandem altimeter data from January 1993 through January 2019 reveals that oceanic vortices appear to have a characteristic surface shape of ``egg'' rather than circle or ellipse as previously understood. Consequently, a second-order moment in eddy morphology is revealed which leads to a~{\textasciitilde}~10~km departure from a standard ellipse in terms of major axis. Furthermore, the sharp poles of oceanic eddies exhibit two quasi-orthogonal modes of orientation: primarily meridional and secondarily zonal. The additional submesoscale asymmetry in eddy shape is confirmed by a consistent anisotropy in a normalized eddy-centric velocity field derived from over 25 thousand drifters. The high-order moments in terms of geometric asymmetry and dynamic anisotropy associated with mesoscale eddies (which are found to be statistically significant at 99\% level) may have profound geophysical and biological impacts on energy transport, substance entrainment, as well as ecosystem dynamics in the ocean. In particular, it is demonstrated that some of the previously identified patterns in eddy properties obtained by non-rotated normalization may be notably biased due to the ignorance of existing eddy orientation.},

  abstract = {Mesoscale eddies exist throughout the global ocean and significantly impact local vertical marine stratification through the physical processes of stirring and pumping. While the vertical transportation dynamics of eddies are known, the contribution to the displacement of pycnocline depth from eddies has not been comprehensively investigated. In this study, the 17-year Argo dataset and satellite altimetry data are used to estimate the deepening and uplifting of the pycnocline depth induced by anticyclonic eddies (AE) and cyclonic eddies (CE), respectively. Pycnocline displacements exhibit multiple geographic and seasonal trends, with the largest magnitude occurring in spring. More pronounced displacements are concentrated in mid-latitudes, particularly along the western boundary currents, with peak displacements reaching more than 90~m. Furthermore, these displacements are positively correlated with eddy properties (particularly eddy amplitude), suggesting that higher intensity eddies may induce larger pycnocline displacements. In the eddy coordinate system, the pycnocline displacement reveals a monopole structure with a marked extremum in the eddy centre. At the eddy core, maximum deepening in AE reaches {\textasciitilde}54~m in spring, but only {\textasciitilde}25~m in autumn. In contrast, uplifting in CE reaches {\textasciitilde}66~m ({\textasciitilde}18~m) in spring (autumn). The eddy-induced pycnocline displacements reported here emphasize the intrinsic vertical dynamics of eddies during oceanic observations and provide a pathway to reproduce the effects of eddies on variations of the pycnocline in ocean models.},

Four principal vertical types of BCI are identified, which are found to exhibit large-scale patterns in the global ocean. The surface- and bottom-intensified type (called the Eady type hereafter) is mainly located in the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) region, locations of the bottom-intensified type (Charney\_b type) are scattered around the Eady type, the surface-intensified type (Charney\_s type) primarily occurs in the subtropics (10{\textdegree}{\textendash}35{\textdegree}), and the interior-intensified type (Phillips type) occurs primarily between 5{\textdegree} and 20{\textdegree} in both hemispheres. More specifically, both geostrophic locations and the depths of the maximum perturbation velocities of the Phillips type BCIs match those of observed subsurface eddies. Moreover, the BCI waves show regions of uniform propagation properties: eastward in the ACC and the mid-latitudes (25{\textdegree}{\textendash}45{\textdegree}), and westward in the low latitudes (30{\textdegree}S{\textendash}30{\textdegree}N) of both hemispheres and in the high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere ({$>$}50{\textdegree}N). These waves resemble normal mode Rossby waves in structure (i.e., first baroclinic, second baroclinic, and topographic Rossby waves), but their propagation speeds are found to be Doppler shifted by the mean flows relevant for the corresponding BCI type. Propagating signals with the same dispersion relationships as the BCI waves are captured with numerical ocean general circulation models.},

Here we introduce and present an overview of the newly developed Regional Community Earth System Model (R-CESM). Different from other existing regional climate models, R-CESM is based on the Community Earth System Model version 2 (CESM2) framework. We have incorporated the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model and Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) into CESM2 as additional components. As such, R-CESM can be conveniently used as a regional dynamical downscaling tool for the global CESM solutions or/and as a standalone high-resolution regional coupled model. The user interface of R-CESM follows that of CESM, making it readily accessible to the broader community. Among countless potential applications of R-CESM, we showcase here a few preliminary studies that illustrate its novel aspects and value. These include 1) assessing the skill of R-CESM in a multiyear, high-resolution, regional coupled simulation of the Gulf of Mexico; 2) examining the impact of WRF and CESM ocean{\textendash}atmosphere coupling physics on tropical cyclone simulations; and 3) a convection-permitting simulation of submesoscale ocean{\textendash}atmosphere interactions. We also discuss capabilities under development such as (i) regional refinement using a high-resolution ROMS nested within global CESM and (ii) ``online'' coupled data assimilation. Our open-source framework (publicly available at https://github.com/ihesp/rcesm1) can be easily adapted to a broad range of applications that are of interest to the users of CESM, WRF, and ROMS.},

  abstract = {The vertical structure of eddies in the Leeuwin Current system affects the eddy volume, heat, and salt transport, even the ecosystem. However, the understanding of eddy vertical structure and eddy-induced transport here are still very limited. In this study, satellite observed sea surface heights were combined with decade-long in situ measurements of Argo floats to study the vertical structure of mesoscale eddies in the LC system and their volume, heat, and salt transport. A novel eddy reconstruction method, which considers the influences of both the eddy and background flow, is devised to study the three-dimensional structure of eddies. Result shows that, in LC system, anticyclonic eddies (AEs) are usually surface-intensified, with the geostrophic velocity decreasing sharply below the mixed layer, while cyclonic eddies (CEs) are subsurface-intensified, with a maximum speed at 240 m. The density anomaly core of the average AE (CE) is at a depth of 130 m (650 m) with a density anomaly of -0.51 (0.24) kg/m3. The volume-integrated eddy kinetic energy and available potential energy of the average CE are much larger than those of the average AE. The average lifespan of CEs is significantly longer than that of AEs, which can be explained by the deeper vertical scale of CEs. The offshore volume transport by eddy drift across the coastal (107{\textdegree}E) section is 9.05 Sv (12.5 Sv). The heat and salt onshore transport by eddy drift across the coastal (107{\textdegree}E) section are, respectively, 10.6 Tw and 143.1 ton/s (17.1 Tw and 241.0 ton/s).},

This paper classifies and analyzes the mesoscale eddies by using the TAPs inside eddies in the Kuroshio Extension（KE）region. Based on the eddy data identified by the satellite altimeter and the Argo TAPs data matched with eddies spacetime，an improved unsupervised clustering method for Gaussian Mixture Modeling（GMM）is proposed to realize the automatic clustering of the Argo TAPs inside the eddies，so as to achieve the automatic classification of eddies matching the space-time profiles. The experimental results show that the same type of Argo TAPs exhibit obvious spatial aggregation results，while the different types of Argo TAPs are spatially separated from each other. Cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies with large anomalies are also found along the southern and northern flank of the Kuroshio path. Compared with the method of directly using a specific area to classify eddies，the eddy classification method proposed in this paper is more objective，and the synthetic analysis of the underwater structure of a specific type of eddy is also more reasonable.},

  abstract = {Some relatively mature mesoscale eddy products have been released for scientific purposes in recent decades. However, the metrics used to identify eddies, the tracking methods, and the definition of the physical parameters are all different across the different datasets, so intercomparisons and validation of these datasets are badly needed. Here, the authors intercompare the basic features of ocean mesoscale eddies in the Kuroshio extension region from four eddy datasets{\textemdash}namely, Chelton, GEM-M, Faghmous, and Dong. In the case study, eddy numbers and locations as well as the eddy tracks identified by the four datasets are compared for a specific date. The authors find that all the datasets have different eddy numbers, but more than 50\% of identified eddies coincide. GEM-M, with the so-called ``segmentation'' algorithm, can identify considerably more eddies than others, while Chelton identifies fewer eddies due to tracking errors, which also lead to a long lifespan. From the analysis of the probability distribution function of eddy features, GEM-M eddies tend to have a larger amplitude and radius and Chelton tends to have long-life eddies. It is further found that the geographic distributions and temporal variation of normalized eddy features are highly similar among the four datasets{\textemdash}particularly among Chelton, Fahgmous, and Dong. In addition, the mean trajectories of the four datasets are generally overlapped initially, and then spread after 245 days. The findings help toward better understanding the uncertainties of eddy features in the Kuroshio extension region. 摘要 在不同的中尺度涡数据中, 涡旋的识别,跟踪方法以及物理参数的定义存在差异, 因此需要对涡旋结果进行相互比较和验证.本文比较了Chelton,GEM-M,Faghmous和Dong四套中尺度涡数据在黑潮延伸体区域的基本特征.结果表明, 各数据的中尺度涡数量,特征和轨迹均存在差异.经过归一化处理后, 涡特征的地理分布和时间变化高度相似, 特别是Chelton,Fahgmous和Dong三套数据.},

The analysis considers the observed variations in stratification and YC transport, and their expected changes due to climate change. The study is based on a set of long-term simulations considering the combination of seven stratification configurations with seven transport configurations resulting in 49 cases. The LCE shedding period and diameter (LCE metrics) and kinetic energy, eddy kinetic energy, available potential energy, eddy available potential energy, and the energy Burger number (energy metrics) are analyzed. The stratification and transport contribute to the current and future LC and LCE variability, with their dynamics being more sensitive to transport variations than to stratification variations. The LCE detachment is associated with the increase in the mass of the LC and its available potential energy budget, which is a primary determinant for the LC and LCE dynamics and a condition for eddy shedding. For the expected changes due to climate change, the LCE response is contrary: larger stratification causes increments in the LCE metrics and energy metrics, except the energy Burger number that decreases; conversely, smaller transport causes the opposite response. A combined occurrence of increased stratification and reduced transport, as expected with climate change, causes decrements in the LCE metrics and energy in the GoM.},

  abstract = {Mediterranean Sea eddies are often generated in fixed geographical locations linked to either bathymetric fluctuations, coastline changes, instabilities around islands, or orographic wind forcing. Because of that, the mean circulation exhibits features with the same special scales as the mesoscale field. We provide here a first comparison of eddies detected and tracked using two altimetry products, the Sea Level Anomaly (SLA) and the Absolute Dynamic Topography (ADT), from 2000 to 2015. We showed that more individual eddies and trajectories are detected in the SLA data than in the ADT, having larger radius but lower Eddy Kinetic Energy. The spatial distribution of the mesoscale activity is different between the two data sets: the ADT-detected eddies closely follow the Mean Dynamic Topography (MDT) patterns which include the mean eddy generation sites whereas the SLA-detected eddies show more spatial homogeneity. The larger eddies are generally well detected in both the ADT or the SLA fields, but the numerous smaller and coastal eddies detected in the SLA fields have a tendency to mismatch the ADT detected eddies. Only 20{\textendash}30\% of eddies are detected exclusively in the SLA or the ADT product (i.e. have no collocation in the other field), whereas to 65{\textendash}80\% of the eddies are detected both in the SLA and the ADT fields. The Ierapetra Eddy is a typical example of the limitation of the SLA-detected eddies, as this orographically controlled feature is present in the MDT and thus leads to an artificial cyclonic eddy in the SLA field that shifts around its most frequent position. This study recommends the use of ADT fields for the detection of mesoscale structures in the Mediterranean Sea where the mean circulation and these mesoscale features have the same spatial scale and intensity, and similarly for any other ocean regions where the MDT contains mesoscale patterns. Yet the ADT fields depend on the accuracy of the MDT, and the altimeter-based SLA fields may be preferable in specific locations where the MDT is not reliable.},

  abstract = {Progress within physical oceanography has been concurrent with the increasing sophistication of tools available for its study. The incorporation of machine learning (ML) techniques offers exciting possibilities for advancing the capacity and speed of established methods and for making substantial and serendipitous discoveries. Beyond vast amounts of complex data ubiquitous in many modern scientific fields, the study of the ocean poses a combination of unique challenges that ML can help address. The observational data available is largely spatially sparse, limited to the surface, and with few time series spanning more than a handful of decades. Important timescales span seconds to millennia, with strong scale interactions and numerical modelling efforts complicated by details such as coastlines. This review covers the current scientific insight offered by applying ML and points to where there is imminent potential. We cover the main three branches of the field: observations, theory, and numerical modelling. Highlighting both challenges and opportunities, we discuss both the historical context and salient ML tools. We focus on the use of ML in situ sampling and satellite observations, and the extent to which ML applications can advance theoretical oceanographic exploration, as well as aid numerical simulations. Applications that are also covered include model error and bias correction and current and potential use within data assimilation. While not without risk, there is great interest in the potential benefits of oceanographic ML applications; this review caters to this interest within the research community.},

Twenty-seven years (January 1993{\textendash}December 2019) of sea level anomaly (SLA) data are analyzed in the Northwest Pacific Ocean (105{\textdegree}E{\textendash}165{\textdegree}W, 0{\textdegree}N{\textendash}60{\textdegree}N). First, we propose a multilevel eddy identification method based on SLA to obtain an eddytree data set, representing a spatial topological tree structure of closed SLA contours with mononuclear eddies, multicore eddies and eddy seeds as the leaf nodes and eddygroups (reflecting the spatial topological relationship among eddies) as the intermediate nodes. The EddyGraph tracking algorithm is applied to the eddytree data set, which results in eddy-directed acyclic graphs (Eddy-DAGs). Only eddies contained within a common eddygroup are tracked as sources in merging events or sinks in splitting events. Furthermore, we extract typical splitting and merging events and composite the sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTAs) inside the eddygroups and eddies during these events. The results confirm that merging eddies in the same eddygroup degenerate into a single eddy and that a splitting eddy evolves into eddies within the same parent eddygroup. Moreover, we match a merging event of cyclonic eddies with in situ data of both drifters and loopers in Lagrangian trajectories. Finally, we present EddyGraph, a data set of mesoscale eddy tracking in the Northwest Pacific Ocean (105{\textdegree}E{\textendash}165{\textdegree}W, 0{\textdegree}N{\textendash}60{\textdegree}N).},

  abstract = {Abstract Encountering of energetic ocean eddies and atmosphere storms makes the winter Kuroshio extension a hotspot for air{\textendash}sea interactions. This second part investigates the regulation of vertical eddy heat transport QT in the winter Kuroshio extension mixed layer by different types of air{\textendash}sea interactions, including the atmosphere synoptic forcing, eddy thermal feedback resulting from eddy-induced surface heat flux anomalies, and eddy current feedback from eddy current's imprint on wind stress. Atmosphere synoptic forcing modulates intraseasonal variation of QT by boosting its component contributed by the turbulent thermal wind balance QTTTW during strong cooling events associated with intense winds. In addition, the magnitude of QT is influenced by the direction of synoptic wind stress primarily via QTTTW, with the latter exhibiting enhancement both in the downfront- and upfront-wind forcing. Enhanced QTTTW by the downfront-wind forcing is attributed to increased turbulent vertical viscosity and front intensity caused by the destabilizing wind-driven Ekman buoyancy flux, whereas interaction of uniform wind stress with smaller turbulent vertical viscosity at the front center than periphery (a so-called internal Ekman pumping) accounts for the increased QTTTW in the upfront-wind forcing. The eddy thermal feedback reduces QT significantly through weakening the fronts. In contrast, the eddy current feedback exerts negligible influences on QT, although it weakens eddy kinetic energy (EKE) evidently. This is due to the much reduced effect of eddy current feedback in damping the fronts compared to EKE and also due to the compensation from Ekman pumping induced by the eddy current feedback.},

  abstract = {Subthermocline eddies (STEs), also termed intrathermocline eddies or submesoscale coherent vortices, are lens-shaped eddies with anomalous water properties located in or below the thermocline. Although STEs have been discovered in many parts of the World Ocean, most of them were observed accidentally in hydrographic profiles, and direct velocity measurements are very rare. In this study, dynamic features of STEs in the Kuroshio Extension (KE) region are examined in detail using concurrent temperature/salinity and velocity measurements from mooring arrays. During the moored observation periods of 2004{\textendash}06 and 2015{\textendash}19, 11 single-core STEs, including 8 with warm/salty cores and 3 with cold/fresh cores, were captured. The thermohaline properties in their cores suggest that these STEs may originate from the subarctic front and the upstream Kuroshio south of Japan. The estimated radius of these STEs varied from 8 to 66 km with the mean value of ;30 km. The warm/salty STEs seemed to be larger and rotate faster than the cold/fresh ones. In addition to single-core STEs, a dual-core STE was observed in the KE recirculation region, which showed that the upper cold/fresh cores stacked vertically over the lower warm/salty cores. Based on the observed parameters of the STEs, their Rossby number and Burger number were further estimated, with values up to 0.5 and 1, respectively. Furthermore, a low Richardson number O (0.25) was found at the periphery of these STEs, suggesting that shear instability-induced turbulent mixing may be an erosion route for the STEs.},

This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the abundance and distribution of MPs in the water and sediment of the South China Sea, as well as their characters such as shape, polymer type, color, and size. Seawater MPs generally showed higher abundances in the coastal than in the basin area, while abundances in sediments showed lower variance. Basin-scale circulation and regional currents or processes, such as mesoscale eddies, and upwelling could influence MPs' horizontal and vertical transport.

However, it remains poorly assessed how the OTEC resources will respond to future climate change. Here, we find that the global OTEC power potential is projected to increase by 46\% around the end of this century under a high carbon emission scenario, compared to its present-day level. The augmented OTEC power potential due to the rising sea surface temperature is partially offset by the deep ocean warming. The offsetting effect is more evident in the Atlantic Ocean than Pacific and Indian Oceans. This is mainly attributed to the weakening of mesoscale eddy-induced upward heat transport, suggesting an important role of mesoscale eddies in regulating the response of thermal stratification and OTEC power potential to greenhouse warming.},

This study explores seasonal variations of global BCI types and their dependence on varying background ocean states with a focus on three representative regions. First, the regions of the Kuroshio Extension and Gulf Stream are representative for distinctive seasonal transition of BCI types: the Charney surface BCIs prevail in winter, while the Phillips BCIs prevail in summer, which is controlled by weak (strong) upper-layer stratification in winter (summer) but is less impacted by the seasonal changes in the mean flow-induced shear. Second, the region covering both the tropics and subtropics of the North Pacific (10{\textdegree}N{\textendash}35{\textdegree}N) is representative for seasonal meridional migration of the border between the domains of the Phillips and the Charney surface BCIs; their border migrates equatorward (poleward) in spring and summer (autumn and winter), which is primarily caused by the equatorward (poleward) shift of both the North Equatorial Current and the Subtropical Countercurrent in spring and summer (autumn and winter), and is secondarily modulated by the variation in the upper-layer stratification. Third, the Antarctic Circumpolar Current region is chosen to represent a weak seasonal variation of BCIs. Those seasonal variations in BCI types are further demonstrated as being associated with seasonal variations of baroclinic conversion rate, implying possible generation of corresponding eddies.},

The two eddies shed from the KE were energetic, with the maximum velocity exceeding 1 m s-1 and relative vorticity magnitude as high as 0.6 f. The Mode Regression Method was proposed to extract NIWs from the shipboard-ADCP velocities. The NIW amplitudes were 0.15 and 0.3 m s-1 in the CE and WE, respectively, and their constant phase lines were nearly slanted along the heaving isopycnals. In the WE, the NIWs were trapped in the negative vorticity core and amplified at the eddy base (at 350{\textendash}650 m), which was consistent with the ``inertial chimney'' effect documented in existing literature. Outstanding NIWs in the background wavefield were also observed inside the positive vorticity core of the CE, despite their lower strength and shallower residence (above 350 m) compared to the counterparts in the WE. Particularly, the near-inertial kinetic energy efficiently propagated downward and amplified below the surface layer in both eddies, leading to an elevated turbulent dissipation rate of up to 10-7 W kg-1. In addition, bidirectional energy exchanges between the NIWs and mesoscale balanced flow occurred during NIWs' downward propagation. The present study provides observational evidence for the enhanced downward NIW propagation by mesoscale eddies, which has significant implications for parameterizing the wind-driven diapycnal mixing in the eddying ocean.},

  abstract = {Sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTAs) induced by oceanic mesoscale eddies trigger mesoscale air-sea interactions and modulate large-scale climate systems. Yet, how eddies drive SSTAs has not been firmly established; particularly, the relative importance of lateral stirring and vertical pumping remains a debated issue. This study investigates characteristics and generation mechanisms of mesoscale eddy SSTAs in three eddy-enriched domains of the North Pacific Ocean: the Kuroshio Extension (KET), the Subtropical Countercurrent (STCC), and the North Equatorial Countercurrent (NECC). Analysis of satellite observational data reveals quasi-monopole eddy SSTAs in the KET and NECC and dipole-like eddy SSTAs in the STCC. By investigating spatial and seasonal variations and performing sensitivity experiments using an idealized model, we demonstrate that lateral stirring plays a more important role than vertical pumping in causing mesoscale eddy SSTAs. The eastward transport by the strong background current UC ({$\sim$}0.6 and {$\sim$}0.4 m s-1 in the KET and the NECC, respectively) and the westward eddy translation UT ({$\sim-$}0.2 m s-1 in the NECC) can dramatically modify the structure of SSTA. The pure stirring effect of eddy rotation velocities generates strong dipole-like SSTAs. Owing to the eastward UC and the westward UT, the western SSTA pole tends to approach the eddy center, while the eastern SSTA pole departs from the eddy and scatters along the eddy trajectory. These effects reduce the eddy SSTA amplitude and favor the emergence of quasi-monopole structure. This work provides a useful benchmark for model simulations of mesoscale SST variability and air-sea interaction.},

The majority of previous studies on the characteristics and distribution of these ocean structures were based on existing definitions of the structure and water mass of interest derived from spatiotemporally limited data. With the massive and spatiotemporal unbiased data accumulated by Argo, data-driven scientific methods may be able to objectively recapture the ocean structure. In this study, we used unsupervised clustering to analyze the temperature and salinity profiles from Argo float in the mid-latitude northwest Pacific Ocean, and the results were compared to previous knowledge of ocean structure. The results showed that classes were distributed to form specific regions and each class has different oceanographic features that generally correspond to the previously described regional divisions. A striking advantage of this new method is that it quantifies the relative abundance of each class of profiles on a 1{\textdegree} grid. Furthermore, we discovered that the dynamic state of Kuroshio Extension (KE) affects the distribution of some classes and the percentage of profiles that are robust to clustering. This suggests that the stability of the KE flow path has an effect on the distribution of ocean structure. These findings suggest that unsupervised clustering is useful in the analysis of oceanographic structures, allowing us to investigate oceanographic structures in areas that have not previously been extensively studied.},

  abstract = {The Mean Dynamic Topography (MDT) is a key reference surface for altimetry. It is needed for the calculation of the ocean absolute dynamic topography, and under the geostrophic approximation, the estimation of surface currents. The MDT is the missing component for the optimal assimilation of altimeter data into operational ocean system. However, in coastal areas, where in-situ measurements are sparse, mainly on the shelf, the global MDT solutions are often less accurate than in the open ocean. Considering the availability of long time-series of high-quality HF-Radar velocity measurements in the Mid Atlantic Bight, the main objective is to include these data to calculate an improved MDT is this area. The prerequisites for the computation of this new Mean Dynamic Topography are to remove the non-geostrophic signal from the HF radar measured velocities. The first step is thus to pre-process these data. We used average currents from December 2006 through November 2016, estimated from HF radars and processed by Rutgers University (https://tds.marine.rutgers.edu/thredds/cool/codar/cat\_totals.html ; Roarty et al, 2021). Then the mean wind-driven currents modelized as in Mulet et al (2021), were removed. Besides, the first guess MDT computed from altimetry and gravimetry was improved by using a dedicated filter along the coast. Finally, the improved MDT was estimated from the first guess MDT and the processed in-situ data (HF-radars, drifters and T/S profiles) through a multivariate objective analysis. This new regional MDT defines better currents near the coast. In particular, the MDT shows more organized across-shelf gradient following the shelf-break, and a more continuous mean flow on the shelf.

  abstract = {The Southern Ocean is a primary heat sink that buffers atmospheric warming and has warmed substantially, accounting for an outsized portion of global warming-induced excess heat in the climate system. However, its projected warming is highly uncertain and varies substantially across climate models. Here, using outputs from Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase six models, we show that Southern Ocean warming during the twenty-first century is linked to the change in amplitude of the El Ni{\~n}o{\textendash}Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Models simulating a larger increase in ENSO amplitude systematically produce a slower Southern Ocean warming; conversely, a smaller increase in ENSO amplitude sees a stronger warming. The asymmetry in amplitude and teleconnection between El Ni{\~n}o and La Ni{\~n}a produce cumulative surface wind anomalies over the southern high latitudes, impacting Southern Ocean heat uptake. The magnitude of inter-model ENSO variations accounts for about 50\% of the uncertainty in the projected Southern Ocean warming.},

  abstract = {Although El Ni{\~n}o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and its global impacts through teleconnection have been known for decades, if and how the mean currents and mesoscale eddies in the Caribbean Sea are linked to ENSO remains an open question. Here, by analyzing satellite observations and an ocean reanalysis product, we found a close connection between mean currents, eddies in the Caribbean Sea and ENSO on interannual timescales. Strong El Ni{\~n}o events result in enhanced north-south sea surface height differences and consequently stronger mean currents in the Caribbean Sea, and the opposite happens during La Ni{\~n}a events. The eddy kinetic energy responds to ENSO via eddy-mean flow interaction, primarily through baroclinic instability, which releases the available potential energy stored in the mean currents to mesoscale eddies. Our results suggest some predictability of the mean currents and eddies in the Caribbean Sea, particularly during strong El Ni{\~n}o and La Ni{\~n}a events.},

  abstract = {The Loop Current (LC), which is the main mesoscale dynamic feature of the Gulf of Mexico (GoM), has a major impact on the circulation and its variability in the interior Gulf. The LC is a highly variable and dynamic feature. It changes shape from a short jet connecting the two openings of the GoM in an almost straight line ("retracted phase") to a long loop invading most of the eastern part of the GoM ("extended phase"). When it is in the extended phase, it can shed large anticyclonic eddies, called Loop Current Eddies, which then migrate to the western GoM. In this study, the processes controlling the LC dynamics are investigated using two multi-decadal simulations of the Gulf of Mexico HYbrid Coordinate Ocean Model differing in their open boundary conditions (BCs) and altimetry-derived gridded fields. The LC in the simulation with BCs derived from monthly climatology state variables frequently remains in its retracted phase significantly longer than observed. In contrast, the duration of the retracted phase is notably shorter in the simulation in which the BCs have realistic daily variability. By examining the flow properties through the Yucatan Channel from which the LC originates, we find that increased intensity of this current and a westward shift of the mean core is associated with the LC transitions from the retracted to the extended phase. This transition is accompanied by an increase of both cyclonicity of the flow in the west and anticyclonicity in the east of the core of this jet. Moreover, the number of anticyclonic eddies entering in the GoM through the Yucatan Channel is significantly higher when the LC extends in the GoM. Consequently, this study demonstrates the importance of realistic flow variability at the lateral boundaries for accurate simulation of the LC system in a model, and reveals characteristics of the upstream flow associated with different LC behavior that can potentially aid in forecasting the LC system.},

  abstract = {Previous studies have shown how the passage of eddies from the Caribbean Sea (CS) to the Gulf of Mexico (GoM) can impact the Loop Current (LC) system, in particular the detachments of LC Eddies (LCEs). Here we used numerical modeling to investigate the impact of the eddy field in the CS on LC predictions. We used a HYCOM ocean model configuration of the North Atlantic at 1/12{\textdegree} resolution to perform two data-assimilative experiments: one in which all available observations were assimilated (Ref), and one in which all available observations were assimilated except in the CS, where climatological altimetry values were assimilated instead of actual observations, leading to dampening the mesoscale activity there (NoCarib). These experiments took place in 2015, when the LC was very active with several LCE detachments, re-attachments, and separations. Each of these experiments was used to initialize 28 60-day forecast simulations every 10 days. In terms of model Sea Surface Height (SSH), the forecasts initialized with the Ref experiment had, on average, lower errors than the forecasts initialized with the NoCarib experiment in the southeastern part of the GoM, with a peak during the 31-40 day forecast period. More importantly, the errors in predicting the date of the next LCE detachment or separation were smaller in the forecasts initialized from the more realistic Ref experiment. Finally, the forecasts initialized by the NoCarib experiment showed a much higher level of false negatives predictions, meaning that no LCE detachment was predicted whereas a detachment actually happened. Overall, 68\% of LCE detachments were predicted with an error smaller than 15 days in the forecasts initialized from the more realistic Ref experiment, but only 32\% in the forecasts initialized from the NoCarib experiment, stressing the importance of the CS eddy field for predicting the LC evolution. These findings have implications on the GoM predictability, highlighting the need to either run data-assimilative models covering both the GoM and the CS, or pay particular attention to accurate boundary conditions for limited-area GoM models.},

  abstract = {Climatologies of the mixed layer depth (MLD) have been provided using several definitions based on temperature/density thresholds or hybrid approaches. The upper ocean pycnocline (UOP) that sits below the mixed layer base remains poorly characterized, though this transition layer is an ubiquitous feature of the ocean surface layer. Available hydrographic profiles provide near-global coverage of the world's ocean and are used to build a seasonal climatology of UOP properties {\textendash} intensity, depth, thickness {\textendash} to characterize the spatial and seasonal variations of upper ocean stratification. The largest stratification values O(10-3s-2) are found in the intertropical band, where seasonal variations of the UOP are also very small. The deepest ({$>$} 200 m) and least stratified O(10-6s-2) UOPs are found in winter along the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) and at high latitudes of the North Atlantic. The UOP thickness has a median value of 23 m with limited seasonal and spatial variations; only a few regions have UOP thicknesses exceeding 35 m. The UOP properties allow the characterization of the upper ocean restratification that generally occurs in early spring and is generally associated with large variability. Depending on the region, this restratification may happen gradually as around the Rockall plateau or abruptly as in the Kuroshio Extension. The UOP is also likely to merge intermittently with the permanent pycnocline in winter. The upper edge of the UOP is eventually close to MLD estimates, except in a few notable regions such as in the Pacific Warm Pool where barrier layers are important, and during wintertime at high latitudes of the North Pacific.},

  abstract = {Mesoscale eddies play an important role in the transport of heat, carbon, and nutrients in the Southern Ocean. Previous studies have documented an increasing intensity of the Southern Ocean eddy field during recent decades; however, it remains unclear whether the mesoscale eddies with different lifetimes have different temporal variations. Using satellite altimeter observations from 1993 to 2020, we found that the increasing trend in the intensity of eddies is dominated by long-lived eddies (with lifetimes {$\geqslant$} 90 d), whose amplitude has increased at a rate of {$\sim$}2.8\% per decade; the increase is concentrated downstream of topography. In contrast, short-lived eddies (with lifetimes {$<$} 90 d) do not appear to have a significant trend in their amplitudes since the early 1990s. An energy conversion analysis indicates that the increased baroclinic instabilities of the mean flows associated with topography are responsible for the amplitude increase of the long-lived eddies. This study highlights the need for a better understanding of the changes in mesoscale eddies owing to their importance in the transport of heat, carbon, and nutrients.},

This study explores the vertical structure of mesoscale eddies in the Kuroshio-Oyashio Extension region (KOE) and its underlying dynamics. By applying the hierarchical ascending classification to the observational and reanalysis data sets, we classify mesoscale eddies with three distinct kinds of vertical structures. Each kind of eddies exhibits clear spatial aggregation along a distinct zonal band. Eddies have core depths of 100{\textendash}300 m in the northern part of the KOE and core depths of 300{\textendash}500 m and 0{\textendash}100 m in the southern. The eddy splitting or merging does not introduce new kind of eddy vertical structure but causes large intra-kind variability. The different kinds of eddy vertical structures can be partially accounted for by the baroclinic instabilities at the eddy generation sites and local adjustment process.},
